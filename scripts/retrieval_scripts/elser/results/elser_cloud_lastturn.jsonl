IBM Cloudant is a highly available managed service able to continue to operate with multiple hardware failures.\n\nThat's the end of this part. The next part is called The Document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The Document video \n\nLearn about IBM Cloudant databases and documents work.\n\n\n\n* The Document video script\n\nWelcome to the Introduction to IBM Cloudant course, an 17-part video series that gives you an overview of the IBM Cloudant database-as-a-service.\n\nThis video is part 2 - The IBM Cloudant Document.\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that IBM Cloudant is a JSON document store. Let's find out what that means in practice and how that compares to other types of database.\n\nMost databases store their data in collections that are called tables, where each unit of data is a row, each with identical, fixed columns. The schema of each table is predefined: a list of columns with their name, date type, value constraints, and relations to other tables carefully defined. Each new record forms a row in a table.\n\nIBM Cloudant is different!\n\nAn IBM Cloudant service includes collections that are called databases (instead of tables) each of which contain any number of documents.\n\nThe example of this slide shows the same data that is expressed in a traditional tabular database and how the same data would be stored in IBM Cloudant as JSON documents.\n\nSo if you come from a relational database background: tables are \"databases\" in IBM Cloudant, and rows are \"documents\".\n\nAn IBM Cloudant document must be a JSON object, starting and ending with curly braces and containing a number of key-value attributes.\n\nJSON objects must be less that 1 megabyte in size and contain any number of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects. The nesting of objects within objects can continue to any depth.\n\nThe keys that are used can be as brief or verbose as you like.\n\nThe following list includes some simple example documents that show how each data type is used.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00550-7-2005", "score": 23.017904, "text": "\nGrouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant \n\nTraditionally, e-commerce systems are built with relational databases. These databases typically use a number of tables joined to record sales, customer details, purchased products, and delivery tracking information.\n\nRelational databases offer high consistency, which means that application developers can build their applications to a database's strengths. This practice includes joins between collections, enumerations to record the state of an object, and database transactions to guarantee atomic operations.\n\nIBM\u00ae Cloudant\u00ae for IBM Cloud\u00ae favors availability over consistency. It's a high-availability, fault-tolerant, distributed database that is eventually consistent. A distributed database means the customer's shopping service is always available and scalable enough to cope with many users who make purchases at the same time. With that in mind, your application can leverage IBM Cloudant's strengths and not treat it like a relational database.\n\nThis discussion outlines some of the factors that are involved in building an e-commerce system that takes advantage of IBM Cloudant's strengths. IBM Cloudant uses concepts that are applicable to many other domains, such as:\n\n\n\n* Using multiple documents to represent the state of a purchase, rather than frequently updating a single document.\n* Storing copies of related objects in order instead of joining to another collection.\n* Creating views to collate documents by order_id to reflect the current state of a purchase.\n\n\n\nFor example, you might create a purchase document that includes details such as the items ordered, customer information, cost, and delivery information.\n\nSee the following example document that describes a purchase:\n\n{\n\"_id\": \"023f7a21dbe8a4177a2816e4ad1ea27e\",\n\"type\": \"purchase\",\n\"order_id\": \"320afa89017426b994162ab004ce3383\",\n\"basket\": [\n{\n\"product_id\": \"A56\",\n\"title\": \"Adele - 25\",\n\"category\": \"Audio CD\",\n\"price\": 8.33,\n\"tax\": 0.2,\n\"quantity\": 2\n},\n{", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_09557-7-2255", "score": 22.818733, "text": "\nUnderstanding high availability and disaster recovery for Cloud Databases \n\nThis document covers all the IBM Cloud\u00ae Databases, which include Databases for DataStax, Databases for Elasticsearch, Databases for EnterpriseDB, Databases for etcd, Databases for MongoDB, Databases for PostgreSQL, Databases for Redis, Messages for RabbitMQ, and Databases for MySQL.\n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Databases instances are deployed in either a multi-zone region (MZR) (for example, Dallas, Frankfurt, London, Sydney, Tokyo, and Washington), or a single-campus multizone region (for example, Chennai). Each instance is deployed in a highly available configuration; that is, data is replicated by each database onto one or more servers, making the data highly available during normal operations.\n\n\n\n* In MZRs, database members are distributed across different data centers, or zones.\n* In single-campus multizone regions, database members are distributed across different hosts.\n\n\n\nIf a single-campus multizone region failure in an MZR or a hardware failure in any region occurs, your data is still accessible as it is replicated onto other fully functioning database servers.

A document is a JSON object with a unique identifier: its _id. A database is a collection of documents with a primary index that allows documents to be retrieved by _id. It also has optional secondary indexes that allow documents to be queried by other attributes in the object.\n\nWhen developers start a project, they sometimes struggle with the following questions:\n\n\n\n* How much data can I put into a single object?\n* Must I store different document types in the same collection or one database per document type?\n\n\n\nIt is important for a document to include all the data about an object that is modeled by your application, for example, a user, an order, or a product. This practice ensures you fetch the entire object from the database in one API call. IBM Cloudant doesn't have the concept of joins like a relational database, so data isn't normalized. However, data can repeat across objects. For example, an order document can include a subset of the product documents that were purchased.\n\nIt's common to store several object types in the same database: a convention is that a type attribute is used to denote the object type. This option is a good one if you need to perform queries that return several object types or if a database needs to be replicated to another location altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloudant-basics"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-25421-27357", "score": 22.455576, "text": "\nType acurl $URL/_all_dbs to see an array of databases.\n\n\n\nA quick note here on formatting JSON on the command line.

Sentence boundary detection works for all supported languages and uses language-specific logic.\n\nFor all project types except Conversational Search, you can change how the passages are displayed in the search results from the Customize display > Search results page. For example, you can configure the number of passages that are shown per document and the maximum character size per passage.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-index-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13498-32548-34436", "score": 13.786511, "text": "\nIn this case, the names _C0, _C1, ... are used for the input columns. For more information, see [COS URI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referenceCOSURI).\n\nBy default, if the format of the input data is JSON, each line must contain a separate, self-contained, and valid JSON object, also called newline-delimited JSON. However, if you specify the option MULTILINE, Data Engine can process JSON input data even if individual data records span multiple lines, such as when the data was formatted to make it easier to read. Specify this option only if you really need it because it limits input parallelization and can significantly reduce performance when you process large volumes of JSON data. If you need to frequently query large amounts of multiline JSON data, use Data Engine to transform the data into single -line JSON, or into a more performance optimized format, such as Parquet, before querying the transformed data.\n\nIf the file format is Parquet, with the optional MERGE SCHEMA clause you can handle Parquet schema evolution by specifying to scan all qualifying Parquet objects for their schema, and to merge the final schema across all objects. By default, for Parquet input only the first Parquet object that is found is used to infer the schema, which guarantees minimal overhead for compiling the SQL. Thus, use this option if your Parquet input data does not have a homogeneous schema.\n\nIf the object type identifier TEXT is used, the input is read line by line without inferring any schema.

Therefore, the data in the database can change between the times when the first and last batches are read.\n* Index definitions held design documents are backed up, but when data is restored the indexes must be rebuilt. This rebuilding might take a considerable amount of time, depending on how much data is restored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Next steps with your data protection strategies \n\nYou can develop applications that build on basic IBM Cloudant functions and supported tools to enable more complex data protection strategies.

IBM Cloudant is expensive as a block store.\n2. IBM Cloudant\u2019s internal implementation is not efficient in handling large amounts of binary data.\n\n\n\nSo, slow and expensive.\n\nIBM Cloudant is acceptable for small assets and occasional use.

These resources would cost $50.4 USD, with the following calculations:\n\n2 instances x 0.5 GB x 720 hours = 720 GB-hours.\n720 GB-hours x $0.07 per GB-hour = $50.4\n\n\n\n\n\n Charges for services \n\nMany services include monthly free allowances.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API.

When you enable security, your assistant takes an additional step to verify that messages originate from the web chat that is embedded in your website only.\n\nThe web chat uses an RSA signature with SHA-256 (RS256) to encrypt communication. RS256 signatures use a sophisticated type of RSA encryption. An RSA key pair includes a private and a public key. The RSA private key is used to generate digital signatures, and the RSA public key is used to verify digital signatures. The complexity of the RSA algorithm that is used to scramble the message makes it nearly impossible to unscramble the message without the key.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates the requests that are sent back and forth to authenticate a request.\n\n![Shows the order in which requests are sent among your website, web chat, and the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/web-chat-security.png)\n\nYou can implement the following security measures:\n\n\n\n* Ensure that messages sent from the web chat to your assistant come from your customers only\n* Send private data from the web chat to your assistant\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nThe process you use to add the web chat to your website is simple.

The web chat is hosted on your site and can inherit any vulnerabilities that your site has. Only serve content over HTTPS, use a Content Security Policy (CSP), and implement other basic web security precautions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Billing \n\nWatson Assistant charges based on the number of unique monthly active users (MAU).\n\nBy default, the web chat creates a unique, anonymous ID the first time a new user starts a session. This identifier is stored in a first-party cookie, which remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site and chats with your assistant again while this cookie is still active, the web chat integration recognizes the user and uses the same user ID. This means that you are charged only once per month for the same anonymous user.\n\nOn Apple devices, the Intelligent Tracking Prevention feature automatically deletes any client-side cookie after 7 days. This means that if an anonymous customer accesses your website and then visits again two weeks later, the two visits are treated as two different MAUs.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 14.821284, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat. The configuration object also specifies details that enable the web chat to connect to your assistant. If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Accessibility \n\nIBM strives to provide products with usable access for everyone, regardless of age or ability.\n\nThe web chat integration complies with the [Web Content Accessibility 2.1 Level AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-21/) standard.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. The web chat is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use, it is secure, and it supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers.\n\nThe web chat is also customizable, which means that you can take advantage of the web chat functionality while still maintaining consistency with your website style and branding, adding custom UI elements, and integrating with external systems (such as live agent tools or CRM systems).\n\n\n\n\n\n What you can do with the web chat \n\nYou can quickly deploy the web chat to your website (or even to a local test page) and see how it works. You can also use the web chat integration settings in the Watson Assistant user interface to configure the web chat for your website and your customers.\n\nIf you are a developer, you can further customize and extend the web chat by writing code and using the web chat API. You can also use a WebView with a JavaScript bridge to add the web chat to your mobile app.\n\nThe following documentation topics provide more information about the capabilities of the web chat integration, how to configure and deploy it, and how to customize it.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16365-8408-10508", "score": 19.817444, "text": "\nThe code snippet that creates the web chat widget includes a configuration object, which you can modify to change the appearance and behavior of the web chat.

If you are comfortable writing JavaScript code, you can customize the web chat by modifying the code snippet and using the web chat API.\n\nThe web chat uses the Watson Assistant v2 stateful API to communicate with the assistant. By default, the session ends and the conversation ends after 5 minutes of inactivity. This means that if a user stops interacting with the assistant, after 5 minutes, any context variable values that were set during the previous conversation are set to null or back to their initial values. You can change the inactivity timeout setting in the assistant settings (if allowed by your plan).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms.

For example, you might need to set initial context data (such as a user ID or account information) or use the web chat security feature. To do this, you can use a JavaScript bridge.\n\nA JavaScript bridge is a common pattern that can be used on all mobile platforms. Implementation details differ from one mobile application framework to another; you can find specific examples on how to implement a JavaScript bridge for the framework you are using. However, the core concept of sending events back and forth between the mobile app and the web chat apply to all frameworks.\n\nWith a JavaScript bridge, events are sent between the mobile app and the WebView, and event listeners exist on both sides of the bridge to handle those events. Each event carries a message payload; because this payload is text-only, you must stringify and parse JSON objects to pass data back and forth.\n\nIf your mobile application needs to call a web chat instance method, you must call the method by sending an event from the app to the WebView using the JavaScript bridge. Similarly, if you need to run code in your mobile application in response to behavior in the web chat, you can send an event through the JavaScript bridge from the web chat to your mobile application.\n\nYou can make use of the user_defined response type and the customResponse event to drive behavior on your mobile application.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-develop-mobile"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16334-20193-22029", "score": 18.777273, "text": "\n* \"User is typing\" support: The web chat now supports displaying the \"user is typing\" message for service desks.

As a result of the node being triggered, your assistant responds with an appropriate answer.\n\n![Shows the user asking about cupcake flavors. the If condition is #cupcake-menu and the Then response is a list of cupcake flavors.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/node1-simple.png)\n\nA single node with one condition and response can handle simple user requests. But, more often than not, users have more sophisticated questions or want help with more complex tasks. You can add child nodes that ask the user to provide any additional information that your assistant needs.\n\n![Shows that the first node in the dialog asks which type of cupcake the user wants, gluten-free or regular, and has two child nodes that provide a different response depending on the user's answer.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/node1-children.png)", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_12890-1796-4070", "score": 16.203245, "text": "\nA database can demonstrate only two of these three attributes for both theoretical and practical reasons. A database prioritizing consistency and availability is simple: a single node stores a single copy of your data. But this model is difficult to scale as you must upgrade the node to get more performance, rather than use extra nodes. And, even a minor system failure can shut down a single-node system, while any message loss means significant data loss. To endure, the system must become more sophisticated.\n\n\n\n Tradeoffs in partition tolerance \n\nA database that prioritizes consistency and partition tolerance commonly employs a primary-secondary setup, where one node of the many in the system is elected leader. Only the leader approves data writes, while all secondary nodes replicate data from the leader to handle reads. If the leader loses connection to the network, or can't communicate with many of the system's nodes, the remainder elects a new leader. This election process differs between systems, and might be a source of [significant problems](https://aphyr.com/posts/284-call-me-maybe-mongodb).\n\nIBM Cloudant prioritizes availability and partition tolerance by employing a primary-primary setup, such that every node can accept both writes and reads to its portion of your data. Multiple nodes include copies of each portion of your data. Each node copies data with other nodes. If a node becomes inaccessible, others can serve in its place while the network heals. This way, the system returns your data in a timely manner despite arbitrary node failure, and maintains [eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency). The tradeoff in deprioritizing absolute consistency is that it takes time for all nodes to see the same data. As a result, some responses might include old data while the new data propagates through the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n Changing the approach \n\nMaintaining one consistent view of data is logical and easy to understand because a relational database does this work for you. The expectation is that web-based services that interact with database systems behave in this way. But that expectation doesn't mean that they do work this way. Consistency isn't a given, and it takes a little work to change the approach.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-cap-theorem"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-65668-67805", "score": 15.704112, "text": "\nData is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster. Three copies of each shard exist, which equals 48 shard copies.\n\nYou don't see any of this activity. The activity is handled for you transparently when you create a database.\n\nWhat happens if a node goes down or needs to be rebooted for maintenance? The rest of the cluster continues as normal. Most shards still have three copies of data but some have only two. API calls continue to work as normal, only two copies of the data are written.\n\nEven if two nodes go down, most shards still have three copies, some have two, and some have one. Writes continue to work, although the HTTP response code reflects that the quorum of two node confirmations wasn't reached.\n\nIt's the same story for reads. Service continues with a failed node. We can survive one failed node...\n\nOr more failed nodes. If a copy of each node exists, the API continues to function.\n\nWhen a node returns, it catches up any missed data from its peers and then returns into service, handling API calls and answering queries for data.\n\nThe nature of this configuration is that IBM Cloudant exhibits eventual consistency. Any node can handle a request. Data is distributed around nodes without the sort of locking that you might see in a relational database.\n\nIBM Cloudant favors availability over consistency: It would rather be up and answering API calls than be down because it can't provide consistency guarantees. (A relational database is often configured in the opposite way: It operates in a consistent manner or not at all.) The upshot of eventual consistency for a developer is that your app must not read its writes in a short time.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03071-3000-4820", "score": 15.621802, "text": "\nYou have successfully enabled the @sys-date, @sys-time, and @sys-number system entities.

For example, a node condition might look for the hello intent in user input, and respond with, Hi. How can I help you? This example is the simplest form of a dialog node, one that contains a single condition and a single response.

A typical dialog tree would likely have many more nodes, but this depiction provides a glimpse of what a subset of nodes might look like.\n\n\n\n* The first root node conditions on an intent value. It has two child nodes that each condition on an entity value. The second child node defines two responses. The first response is returned to the user if the value of the context variable matches the value specified in the condition. Otherwise, the second response is returned.\n\nThis standard type of node is useful to capture questions about a certain topic and then in the root response ask a follow-up question that is addressed by the child nodes. For example, it might recognize a user question about discounts and ask a follow-up question about whether the user is a member of any associations with which the company has special discount arrangements. And the child nodes provide different responses based on the user's answer to the question about association membership.\n* The second root node is a node with slots. It also conditions on an intent value. It defines a set of slots, one for each piece of information that you want to collect from the user. Each slot asks a question to elicit the answer from the user. It looks for a specific entity value in the user's reply to the prompt, which it then saves in a slot context variable.\n\nThis type of node is useful for collecting details you might need to perform a transaction on the user's behalf. For example, if the user's intent is to book a flight, the slots can collect the origin and destination location information, travel dates, and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Ready to get started? \n\nFor more information, see [Creating a dialog](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-overview).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-build"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02961-7-1871", "score": 15.328005, "text": "\nDialog building tips \n\nGet tips about ways to address common tasks.\n\n\n\n Adding nodes \n\n\n\n* Add a node name that describes the purpose of the node.\n\nYou currently know what the node does, but months from now you might not.

This guarantees zero data loss, with a potential performance impact on a highly transactional workload if network latency is high. You can have two synchronous-commit replicas per AG. This mode is best suited for instances in the same AZ or MZR.\n* Asynchronous - The transaction is considered committed as soon as it is hardened in the transaction log on the primary replica. If there is an issue before the logs are hardened on all of the secondary replicas, data loss is possible, and the recovery point would be the most recently committed transaction that was successful on all of the secondary replicas.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API.

It supports the various types of SELECT statements from the ANSI SQL standard.\n\nThe SELECT statement (or query statement) is used to read object data from IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage (COS), process the data, and store it back on Cloud Object Storage eventually.\n\nYou can use Data Engine as a data transformation service, as it always writes the results of a query to a specified location in either Object Storage or Db2 tables. Data Engine provides extended SQL syntax inside a special INTO clause to control how the result data is stored physically. This extended SQL syntax includes control over data location, format, layout, and partitioning.\n\nA query statement can be submitted through Data Engine's web UI or programmatically, either by using the service's REST API, or by using the Python or Node.JS SDK. You can also use IBM Watson\u00ae Studio and the Python SDK to use Data Engine interactively with Jupyter Notebooks. In addition, you can submit SQL queries that use IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.\n\nIn addition to the ad hoc usage of data in IBM Cloud\u00ae Object Storage, you can also register and manage your data in a catalog as tables, consisting of columns and partitions.\n\nSeveral benefits to cataloging your data exist:\n\n\n\n* It simplifies SQL SELECT statements because the SQL author does not need not know and specify exactly where and how the data is stored.\n* The SQL execution can skip the inference of schema and partitioning because this information is available in the metastore. Thus, cataloging improves your query performance, especially for text-based data formats, such as CSV and JSON, where the schema inference requires a full scan of the data before the actual query execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Select \n\nSee the following examples for an outline of the general syntax of an SQL query statement that uses the query clause and the namedQuery clause.\n\n\n\n query \n\n\n\n\n\n namedQuery \n\n\n\n\n\n intoClause \n\nThe query statement supports common table expressions.

To avoid an infinite loop, use step conditions to ensure that this step only executes when it is appropriate for previous steps to be repeated.

Objects of queryable data formats, as well as folders with multiple objects of a consistent queryable format (when shown in the \"folders\" view) are labeled as shown in Figure 4.\n\nZoom\n\n![Object with SQL label](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/63322f2f3a72050206eb05ba7f590fdcb741105c/cloud-object-storage/images/accessible-using-sql.jpg)\n\nFigure 4.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-sql-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13493-2289-4276", "score": 12.797178, "text": "\n* Use the INTO clause of a [query](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencechapterSQLQueryStatement) to specify the output [URI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-runningunique), that is, the location to which the result is to be written and the wanted result format.\n\n\n\n2. The Target location field displays where the result is stored. An initial bucket in one of your Object Storage instances is automatically created for you when you open the UI.

As noted, every example must include a label that indicates the \"goodness\" or \"badness\" of the document as it pertains to the query.\n\nExamples can optionally specify a cross-reference query. The cross-reference query needs to return only the example document and must be independent of the unique Watson Discovery document ID.

Calling this API with the appropriate information when a user performs an action sends a signal back to Discovery, which can then be viewed in the logs.\n\nEvents can help gather information on computing metrics (like clickthrough rate) to measure how effective the application is at helping end users find relevant information, or can be used to help seed training by reviewing the queries and clicks to start to build ground truth.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-usage"}]}

This action means making requests of many individual database servers. The API coordination node receives the responses from all these servers and combines them to form a single response to the client. This response might involve buffering data and delaying the response to the client if, for example, data requires sorting.\n\n\n\n\n\n Partition querying \n\nYou can make partition queries to the following index types:\n\n\n\n* IBM Cloudant Query\n* Views\n* Search\n\n\n\nWhen you make a partition query, the database can query just the data within a single partition. A partition's data resides in just one shard (with three replicas). The API coordination node can make a request directly to servers that host that data rather than needing to combine responses from many servers. The API coordination node is also free from buffering the response since it has no combination step to carry out. As a result, the data arrives at the client more quickly.\n\nAs the size of a database increases, the number of shards must also increase. The increase in shards directly increases the number of queries that the API coordination node needs to make to servers that host data when you use global queries. However, when you use partition queries, the number of shards has no effect on the number of servers the API coordination node needs to contact. As this number stays small, increasing data size has no effect on query latency, unlike global queries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases tutorials \n\nYou can see two examples of using partitioned databases:\n\n\n\n1.

Such a table improves performance for repeated query executions.\n\nAnother advantage of creating a table in the catalog is that the table name serves as an alias and is decoupled from the data location. Hence, you can separate the tasks of data engineers and SQL authors. Data engineers deal with the data location and publish registered tables in the catalog by using descriptive table names. Hence, SQL authors are able to compose queries without having to know the exact location and format of data on Object Storage. If the data location changes, only the table in the catalog must be updated, but the table name remains unchanged. Updates of the physical data structure are simplified and the robustness of SQL statements and applications is increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n Usage \n\nYou manage the database catalog in Data Engine with Database Definition Language (DDL) statements that you submit just like any other SQL query statement. The catalog is stored independently of Object Storage: No data is written to Object Storage when you create or change table definitions, and no data is deleted from Object Storage when you drop a table definition. To call the catalog management statements, you need the Manager user role assigned.\n\nTo register a new table in the catalog, use the CREATE TABLE statement, as in the following example:\n\nCREATE TABLE employees\nUSING PARQUET\nLOCATION cos://us-geo/sql/employees.parquet\n\nThe statement automatically detects the schema of the data at the location that is indicated. See the [SQL reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sql-query?topic=sql-query-sql-referencecreateTable) for options that can be set on the table.\n\nUse the DESCRIBE TABLE statement to verify the detected table schema:\n\nDESCRIBE TABLE employees\n\nIf the DESCRIBE TABLE output shows partition information, you must run an ALTER TABLE ...

For all these reasons, it is important to pick the appropriate data type.\n3. Specify whether Not null is true or false.\nA column that allows NULL values also allows rows to be inserted with no value in that column. A column that does not allow NULL values does not accept rows with no value.\n4. Specify the default value to be used if no value is specified when a row is inserted.\n5.

CouchDB 4 is built on different technology.\n\nIBM Cloudant is a distributed database with data that is stored around a cluster of storage nodes. Picture the IBM Cloudant service as ring of nodes, in this case twelve. Every node can deal with incoming API calls and every node has responsibility for storing some of the data: shards and associated secondary indexes of databases that exist in the cluster.\n\nWhen data is written to IBM Cloudant, one of the nodes in the ring handles the request: Its job is to instruct three copies of the data to be stored in three storage nodes. Data is stored in triplicate in IBM Cloudant, so each shard of a database is stored multiple times, often across a region's availability zones.\n\nWhen you make an API call to write data and get a response back, we write the data to at least two of the three storage nodes. Data is flushed to disk - it isn't cached in memory to be flushed data. We consider that technique too risky and prone to data loss.\n\nWhen you create a database, a number of database shards are created (16 by default) which are spread around the cluster.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-learning-center"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00522-2652-4218", "score": 22.550165, "text": "\nOpen the service instance that you created in the prerequisite section.\n3.

It is a flexible API that must be used carefully to ensure that database performance can be maintained as the data size grows over time.\n\n\n\n How do I use IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nIBM Cloudant Query is accessed through the [POST /{db}/_find](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostfind) API endpoint where the JSON specification of the query is passed in the HTTP POST body. For example, this query finds up to 10 documents where the firstname is \"Charles\" and the surname is \"Dickens\":\n\n{\n\"selector\": {\n\"firstname\": \"Charles\",\n\"surname\": \"Dickens\"\n},\n\"limit\": 10\n}\n\nFor more information, see [Selector Syntax](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-queryselector-syntax).\n\n\n\n\n\n How do I create an index to support an IBM Cloudant Query? \n\nWithout a suitable secondary index, IBM Cloudant Query scans each document in the database in turn until it has enough matches to satisfy the query. The larger the data set and the more documents it has to scan to find matching documents, the slower the response time. For faster performance, an IBM Cloudant Query _find must be backed by a suitable secondary index. A secondary index is a pre-calculated data structure that allows IBM Cloudant to quickly jump to the slice of data it needs without scanning irrelevant documents. For the surname fields, we call the [POST /{db}/_index](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/cloudantpostindex) endpoint to pass the JSON index definition as the HTTP POST body:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\"firstname\", \"surname\"]\n},\n\"ddoc\": \"jsonindexes\",", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-faq-using-cloudant-query"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00580-62356-64581", "score": 22.192104, "text": "\nSometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz.

This example shows a range query on a string field.\n* Find documents whose price is 0 - 100AND whose year is in the 19th century or whose author matches charles dickens. This example shows how logic can be built into queries.\n\n\n\nIBM Cloudant Search is useful not only for free-text search. It is also useful when you know which attributes you are going to search on, but the queries are varied, with different combinations of attributes each time. This flexibility is difficult to implement with fixed-order MapReduce indexes.\n\nFaceting is a form of aggregation. You nominate individual indexed fields for faceting at index-time and activate the aggregation with parameters at query-time.\n\nIt has two uses:\n\nCounting repeating values in the result set, such as the counts of products that belong to each category in a result set. Or, counting numbers of items in numeric ranges, such as the product counts in each of the price ranges. Both of these forms of counts can be presented to a front-end user as a means of further filtering an existing search to narrow the scope of the search. For example, a customer searches for Fender, then clicks Amps then on a price range under $500. All of this search and filtering can be powered by IBM Cloudant Search.\n\nTo summarize, IBM Cloudant Search indexes are defined with a supplied JavaScript function. They are built on Apache Lucene and are primarily used for free-text search matching, but the query language is useful for building flexible queries on a fixed set of indexed fields.

Before this time, it also allows some aggregation functionality that uses a technique that is called faceting.\n\nAn IBM Cloudant Search index is created by supplying JavaScript function. It is not unlike MapReduce, except this time, the emit function is replaced by an index function, which expects the name of the field, the data itself, and some options.\n\nIn this example, the document's name and title are indexed with default options. The category is nominated for faceting (the aggregation functionality) and the ISBN is stored in the index but not indexed for search itself. Sometimes it is more efficient to store some items in the index rather than doing include_docs=true at query time.\n\nLucene has its own query language that creates queries that match combinations of clauses with logic, fuzzy matching, ranges, and term boosting.\n\nSee the following examples:\n\n\n\n* Find documents whose title matches gastby and whose author starts with fitz.

This practice is costly in terms of performance, as every lookup is a full scan of the database rather than an indexed lookup. If your data is small, this full-scan lookup doesn\u2019t matter, but as the data set grows, performance becomes a problem for you, and for the cluster as a whole. It is likely that we will limit this facility soon. The IBM Cloudant Dashboard provides a method for creating indexes in an easy way.\n\nCreating indexes and crafting IBM Cloudant Queries that take advantage of them requires some flair. To identify which index is being used by a particular query, send a POST to the _explain endpoint for the database, with the query as data.\n\nFor more information, see [IBM Cloudant Query docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-query).\n\n\n\n\n\n In IBM Cloudant Search (or IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text), limit the number of fields \n\nIBM Cloudant Search and IBM Cloudant Query indexes of type text (both of which are Apache Lucene under the hood) provide you with a way to index any number of fields into the index. Some examples exist where this type of indexing is abused either deliberately, or mostly by mistake. Plan your indexing to comprise only the fields required by your actual queries. Indexes take up space and can be costly to rebuild if the number of indexed fields are large.\n\nWe also have the issue of which fields that you store in an IBM Cloudant Search.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-indexing-and-querying"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_00491-1283-3050", "score": 21.887848, "text": "\n(Optional) [Create an acurl alias](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-working-with-curlencode-user-name-and-password).\n\n\n\nIf you decide not to set up acurl, use the following URL with curl instead of the one provided in the exercises, curl \"https://$USERNAME:$PASSWORD@$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/databasedemo\".\n\nThe acurl alias is more secure.

IBM Cloudant Query is a combination of a view and a search index.\n\nWhen you use IBM Cloudant Query, the query planner looks at the selector (your query) to determine the correct index to choose from. In memory, you filter out the documents by the selector, which is why, even without an index, you can still query with various fields.\n\nIf no available defined index matches the specified query, then IBM Cloudant uses the _all_docs index, which looks up documents by ID. In the worst case scenario, it returns all the documents by ID (full table scan). Full table scans are expensive to process. It is recommended that you create an index.\n\nTo create an index, follow these steps:\n\n\n\n1. Copy the following sample JSON data into a file named query-demo-index.json:\n\n{\n\"index\": {\n\"fields\": [\n\"descriptionField\",\n\"temperatureField\"\n],\n\"partial_filter_selector\": {\n\"descriptionField\": {", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-creating-an-ibm-cloudant-query"}]}

So, when a user signs up for your app, you ask them a few questions with answers that they can choose from. For example, you might ask the following question:\n\nDo you have any dietary preferences?\n\n\n\n* I'm a vegetarian.\n* I'm a pescatarian.\n* I'm dairy-free.\n* I'm gluten-free.\n* I'm low carb.\n\n\n\nYou can then map their answers to [specific attributes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-profiles) that you can use to target the advertising that they're shown.\n\nAlthough this tutorial is written for web apps that use Cloud Directory, attributes can be used in a much broader sense. Custom attributes can be anything that you want them to be! If you stay under 100k attributes and you format them as a plain JSON object, you can store all types of information.\n\n\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nReady? Let's get started!\n\nBe sure that you have the following prerequisites before you begin:\n\n\n\n* An instance of the App ID service\n* A set of service credentials\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Configuring your App ID instance \n\nBefore you can start adding attributes for your users, you need to configure your instance of App ID.\n\n\n\n1.

The information in the profile can be learned about your users by the way that they interact with your app or added by you on their behalf. By storing the information, you can access it to help create personalized experiences of your app for your users.\n\nLooking for information about your Cloud Directory users? Check out [managing users](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/appid?topic=appid-cd-users).\n\n\n\n Viewing user profiles with the UI \n\nTo see the data that is available for your app users, you can use the App ID UI.\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the User Profiles > Profiles tab of your App ID instance.\n2. Look through the table or search by using an email address to find the user that you want to see the information for. The search term must be exact.\n3. In the overflow menu of the user's row, click View user profile. A page opens that contains the user's information.

Stay to the lower end of the range if the human annotators who will be working on the workspace are not highly specialized in the field. Do not define more than 50.\n\nPlan to spend a good amount of time defining the type system before your team begins any human annotation tasks. When the team does start to annotate documents, begin with a small set, perhaps no more than 50. Annotate only mentions initially, examine the results, and refine your annotation guidelines and the type system as needed. When you're satisfied with the results of mention annotation, move on to annotate relations and coreferences.\n\nWhile fundamental work is underway to define a set of entity types and mention-annotation guidelines, avoid putting a lot of effort into annotating relation mentions. Mention changes will undo relation annotation work. Do take some time to define a set of relation types and their allowable entity type pairs so that relation type needs are taken into consideration before the entity type inventory is finalized.\n\nExpect the type system to evolve with the experience of people trying to annotate to it. If you revise the type system after you create human annotation tasks, you must decide whether to apply the changes to each task. If you apply the changes, human annotators will have to revisit the documents that they annotated previously.\n\nWhen you test the model, you can review statistics that show how frequently the entity types and relation types occur in your sample documents.

The human annotator annotates the documents in the annotation set. To later use inter-annotator scores to compare the annotations that are added by each human annotator, you must assign at least two human annotators to different annotation sets. You must also specify that some percentage of documents overlap between the sets.\n\n> Note: In a realistic scenario, you would create as many annotation sets as needed, based on the number of human annotators who are working in the workspace. In this tutorial, you will create two annotation sets. If you do not have access to multiple user IDs, you can assign both annotation sets to the same user.\n\nFor more information about annotation sets and annotation tasks, see [Creating an annotation task](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-annotate-documentswks_hatask).\n\n\n\n\n\n Procedure \n\n\n\n1.

For more information, see [About restoring from a backup snapshot](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore).\n\n\n\n\n\n Am I charged for usage? \n\nYes. Cost for backups is calculated based on GB capacity that is stored per month, unless the duration is less than one month. The backup exists on the account until it reaches its retention period, or when you delete it manually, or when you reach the end of a billing cycle, whichever comes first.\n\nPricing of subsequent backups can also increase or decrease when you [increase source volume capacity](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-expanding-block-storage-volumes) or [adjust IOPS](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-adjusting-volume-iops) by specifying a different IOPS profile for the source volume. For example, expanding volume capacity increases costs. However, changing an IOPS profile from a 5-IOPS/GB tier to a 3-IOPS/GB tier decreases the monthly and hourly rate. Billing for an updated volume is automatically updated to add the prorated difference of the new price to the current billing cycle. The new full amount is then billed in the next billing cycle.\n\nPricing for backups is also set by region of the source volume.

You can create backup snapshots as frequently as 1 hour. You can also create copies of your backup snapshot in other regions.

For our purposes, high availability within a single cloud region (\n\nMZR) can be achieved by eliminating single points of failure. For more information on HA, see [Considerations for high availability](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-ha-considerations).\n\nHA usually doesn\u2019t deal with major unplanned or planned issues, such as complete site loss because of major power outages, earthquakes, severe hardware failures, full site connectivity loss, and more. In such cases, if the service must meet strict Service Level Objectives (SLO), you should make the whole application stack (infrastructure, services, and application components) redundant by deploying it in at least two different cloud regions. This is typically defined as a DR architecture.\n\nThe benefits of using a [DR orchestrator](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-cloud-resiliency-orchestrator) are covered in the context of a cloud environment and its fast changing behavior. You might require several integrations with management tools and services in IBM Cloud\u00ae. Examples throughout these best practices are provided to demonstrate the native capabilities and documentation currently available to implement DR for IBM Cloud services and suggest additional services that are often required to implement an enterprise-level resiliency solution.\n\nThe best practices in this section are based on the services and features currently available and might change over time. We recommend that you verify possible changes or additional features that might apply to your environment.\n\n\n\n General disaster recovery strategy \n\nThe approach to defining your DR strategy needs to be systematic and start with the application or service, which is defined as a set of compute resources, for example Kubernetes apps, virtual machines, services, and more, that make up a business application.\n\nWhile a holistic approach might be wanted, the reality is that each business application (cloud service) is independent, with its own", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-understanding-dr"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07502-5502-7788", "score": 17.04995, "text": "\nThe disaster recovery kit is an off-site and protected repository that includes hardware, software, and system secure configurations, one-time keys, and the disaster recovery plan.

Include implementation of backups as part of deployable architectures. Keep backup configuration close to provisioning code so that it is easier to ensure that backups are adjusted as information system changes occur. Create and configure backup accounts as code.\n\n\n\n\n\n Backup accounts \n\nEach BU account group should include a separate backup account and an additional backup account should be used for the centralized accounts. These backup accounts provide an extra layer of protection for the confidentiality and integrity of the backed up data. If credentials to a source account are compromised, it should not be possible to use that access to tamper with backups.\n\nSupporting this effort, authorization to backup data in the backup account should use service-to-service or service to trusted profile authorization where possible. Otherwise, use secure storage of credentials with least privilege access.\n\nIf you are using Cloud Object Storage for backup, at minimum, use separate buckets for backing up different workload accounts. Also, use separate backup credentials for each bucket where service to service policies are not possible.

In the case of prolonged unavailability of the primary site, the application stack is activated in the backup site. Often that requires the restoring of backups that are taken in the primary site. This approach is not recommended when losing data can be a problem, for example when the RPO is less than a few hours or when the availability of the service is critical and the RTO objective is less than a few hours.\n\nActive/Standby\n: In the Active/Standby case, the full application stack is active in both the primary and backup location.

To minimize the downtime of the service and impact to your business, you could implement a manual failover to switch to another region while the region is being restored. To reduce the time to get up and running in a new location, consider using access groups to manage permissions working with the service, and backup the monitoring metadata of each instance.

DevSecOps integrates a set of security and compliance controls into the DevOps processes. This feature allows organizations to deliver rapidly and often while they maintain a strong security posture and continuous state of audit-readiness.\n\nLike Agile and DevOps, DevSecOps introduces a culture change and removes the traditional barriers between Developers, Operations, and Security and Compliance officers. Development teams take greater ownership of security rather than relying on external teams to evaluate their software for security, often late in the development cycle when discovered vulnerabilities are more disruptive and expensive to remediate. The old model of having a siloed security team does not scale and does not meet the needs of a development project in a cloud-native DevOps domain. With DevSecOps, a security team's purpose evolves to more of a supportive, advising, and governance role.\n\nWith DevSecOps, developers can continue to deliver updates frequently with a minimal amount of friction. Integration of automated security scans and controls into the DevOps pipelines provides confidence with evidence to the change management process. This integration also supports automated approvals of new deployments to production when all secure criteria are met and specific checks pass. Introducing security and compliance early into the development and deployment process reduces costs and risk by identifying problems early before the software reaches a production environment. This approach is often referred to as \"shift-left\". Moreover, even if secure best practices are part of the training in every organization, developers might lack deep expertise at the security level. Applying DevSecOps and shift-left to the delivery lifecycle reduces the risk of naively releasing known vulnerabilities into production.\n\nOrganizations can take advantage of the significant benefits of using a standard set of processes for continuous integration and continuous delivery by multiple disparate teams that develop heterogeneous offerings and components.

Virtual networks reproduce the Layer2 - Layer7 network model in software, allowing complex multitier network topologies to be created and provisioned programmatically in seconds, without the need for extra IBM Cloud private networks. NSX also provides a new model for network security. Security profiles are distributed to and enforced by virtual ports and move with virtual machines.\n\nNSX supports the VMware software-defined data center strategy. By extending the virtualization capabilities of abstraction, pooling and automation across all data center resources and services, the software-defined data center architecture simplifies and speeds the provisioning and management of compute, storage, and networking resources through policy-driven automation. By virtualizing the network, NSX delivers a new operational model for networking that breaks through current physical network barriers and enables VMware and IBM Cloud to achieve better speed and agility with reduced costs.\n\nNSX includes a library of logical networking services - logical switches, logical routers, logical firewalls, logical load balancers, logical VPN, and distributed security. You can create custom combinations of these services in isolated software-based virtual networks that support existing applications without modification, or deliver unique requirements for new application workloads. Virtual networks are programmatically provisioned and managed independent of IBM Cloud networking constructs. This decoupling from hardware introduces agility, speed, and operational efficiency that can transform data center operations. Benefits of NSX include the following features:\n\n\n\n* Data center automation\n* Self-service networking services\n* Rapid application deployment with automated network and service provisioning\n* Isolation of development, test, and production environments on the same bare metal infrastructure\n* Single Account multi-tenant clouds\n\n\n\nNSX can be configured through the vSphere Web Client, a command line interface (CLI), and REST API.

The software is based on the innovative SAP HANA database technology and was started as the fourth product generation in 2015. Users can choose between the SAP S/4HANA Cloud and On-Premise solution.\n\nAn ERP system is used for demand-oriented business resource planning. It is used to control processes and to link departments and functional areas in a meaningful way. Individual modules include applications for accounting, sales, production, and marketing. More complex tasks in customer or supply chain management can also be done by ERP software. As the successor to the core product SAP ECC, SAP S/4HANA was presented as the intelligent ERP system of the new generation. Thanks to modern technologies, the Software as Service (SaaS) version is designed to help companies standardize processes and make the leap to digitalization.\n\nWhile previous SAP ERP solutions support the most common databases, SAP S/4HANA uses exclusively the SAP HANA in-memory database developed by SAP. This in-memory database offers users the greatest technical benefit and they benefit from increased performance. The \"S\" in S/4HANA stands for \"simple\", while the \"4\" refers to the generation sequence. Compared to the SAP core product SAP ECC, which is still used in most companies, SAP S/4HANA offers many innovative functions that revolutionize the system landscape from the ground up. As SAP plans to discontinue the mainstream maintenance of its existing ERP solutions by 2027, many SAP ECC users are already considering a migration to SAP HA SZ S/4HANA\n\n\n\n\n\n What is created \n\nThe scripts work in two phases.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/sap?topic=sap-automate-s4hana-ha-terraform-ansible"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_10834-3188-5278", "score": 13.935305, "text": "\nWhether you have an app already or plan to develop a script to use, your code probably needs a few tweaks to make it consumable by IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions.

It works transparently in the background, converting human-readable website names into computer-readable, numerical IP addresses that follow the [internet's RFC 1918 guidelines for IPv4 and RFC 4193 for IPv6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network). In short, DNS servers match domain names, such as ibm.com, to their associated IP addresses, which most people do not need to know.\n\nThe DNS system looks up this IP address and host name information on a network of linked DNS servers across the internet, similarly to how people might look for someplace using a phone book or a map.\n\n\n\n Name servers \n\nA name server implements services that provide responses to queries against a directory service. It translates meaningful, text-based web or host identifiers into IP addresses.\n\nName server delegation takes place when a name server for a domain receives a request for a subdomain's records and responds with the name server's reference to the delegate server.

Client VPN for VPC supports the following protocols:\n\nUDP is recommended for optimal performance; TCP for reliability.\n\n\n\n* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)\n\nThe User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simple, lightweight protocol with minimum overhead. If a process wants to send a small message and doesn't care about reliability, it can use UDP. Sending a message by using UDP takes much less time than using TCP. It performs little error checking and does not add any advantages to IP services except to provide process-to-process communication instead of host-to-host communication.\n* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)\n\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a reliable but complex transport-layer protocol. TCP adds connection-oriented features and reliability to IP services.\n\nTCP is a stream delivery service that guarantees delivery of data streams sent from one host to another without duplication or lost data. Since packet transfer is not reliable, a technique known as positive acknowledgment with retransmission is used to guarantee reliability of packet transfers. This fundamental technique requires the receiver to respond with an acknowledgment message as it receives the data.\n\nThe sender keeps a record of each packet it sends, and waits for acknowledgment before sending the next packet. The sender also keeps a timer from when the packet was sent, and retransmits a packet if the timer expires. This timer is needed in case a packet becomes lost or corrupted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Full versus split-tunnel mode \n\nWhen a VPN connection is set up, an encrypted tunnel is created over the internet to the VPN server. The VPN connection appears as a virtual network interface to the computer in addition to the existing LAN interface. You can now use both interfaces simultaneously by sending the private traffic destined to the VPC inside the VPN tunnel and the public traffic (internet traffic) over the other interface (outside the VPN tunnel).

These subject matter experts can focus on designing an engaging conversational flow. In fact, the actions skill is designed with this type of expert in mind. The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both. Leverage advanced capabilities that are available from a dialog skill and build individual actions to perform finite tasks that you want to support. You can call the actions in your actions skill from your dialog skill.\n\nFor more information, see [Choosing a conversational skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skills-choose).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistants"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-4813-6717", "score": 25.324118, "text": "\nFor more information, see [Configuring bidirectional languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-supportlanguage-support-configure-bidirectional).\n\n\n\nNext, start building your conversation.\n\nAs you follow the normal steps to design a conversational flow, you teach the universal language model about the language you want your skill to support. It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. For an actions skill, add actions. For a dialog skill, add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_03120-1659-3917", "score": 24.168016, "text": "\nThe precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\nFor example, use the web chat integration with your French-speaking assistant to deploy to a French-language page on your website. Deploy your German-speaking assistant to the German page of your website. Maybe you have a support phone number for French customers. You can configure your French-speaking assistant to answer those calls, and configure another phone number that German customers can use.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill.

For more information about ways to approach language support, see [Adding support for global audiences](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language).\n\n\n\n\n\n Does your assistant see the glass as half full? \n\nIs your assistant an optimist or a pessimist, a shy intellectual type, or an upbeat sidekick? Choose a personality for your assistant, and then write conversations that reflect that personality. Don't overdo it. Don't sacrifice usability for the sake of keeping your assistant in character. But strive to present a consistent tone and attitude.\n\nNever misrepresent the assistant as being a human. If users believe the assistant is a person, then find out it's not, they are likely to distrust it.

The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise. This set of users might prefer to build the conversational flow with a dialog skill because there is greater visibility into the individual components that make up the training data.\n\nSo, which conversational skill type should you use?\n\nUse both.

However, when you provision an instance by restoring a boot volume from a bootable backup snapshot, you can expect degraded performance in the beginning.

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs.

However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match.

But just as with any method of encryption, going back to the earliest known ciphertexts created thousands of years ago, the trick is not just to encrypt information so that it cannot be decoded easily but to protect the ciphers used to encrypt and decrypt it (since having a cipher is as good as having the data).\n\nWhile it is possible to set up a hardware security module (HSM) on premises to manage your data, this kind of system can be very expensive to establish and manage. Cloud-based storage, where encrypted data must be accessible at scale and at speed from a variety of permissioned actors, is less expensive, but has its own difficulties. How can you be sure that the data is secure when the key used to encrypt it (what's known as a \"data encryption key\") could exist on dozens if not hundreds of computers spread all over the world?

You can use this ID value to make API calls to the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n How it works \n\nEnvelope encryption combines the strength of multiple encryption algorithms to protect your sensitive data in the cloud. It works by wrapping one or more data encryption keys (DEKs) with advanced encryption by using a root key that you can fully manage. This key wrapping process creates wrapped DEKs that protect your stored data from unauthorized access or exposure. Unwrapping a DEK reverses the envelope encryption process by using the same root key, resulting in decrypted and authenticated data.\n\nRoot keys that are managed in a Hyper Protect Crypto Services service instance are also encrypted by the master key that ensures you full control of the entire key hierarchy.\n\nThe following diagram shows a contextual view of envelope encryption.\n\nZoom\n\n![The diagram shows a contextual view of envelope encryption.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/217f108cc44e2ce15fb692d4b57b4c628464e908/hs-crypto//images/envelope-encryption.svg)\n\nFigure 1.

This requirement is necessary for \"High Availability\" (HA). It means that you provide the best possible continuous data availability after a hardware failure. Different HA techniques tolerate different levels of failure before operations are affected.\n\nYou might want to have quick and easy ways of backing up and restoring data. For example, after a severe or extensive hardware failure, you want the ability to make all the data available on an alternative system as quickly as possible. This requirement is necessary for \"Disaster Recovery\" (DR). A disaster generally means that a database is no longer available in one or more locations. For example, a power outage might cause all systems in a database cluster to fail. Or a large-scale network failure might mean systems in a cluster can't be contacted, even though they continue to work correctly.\n\nAddressing your HA or DR requirements often begins by simplifying the problem into more generic requirements. When you identify your requirements, you can apply the tools and features that help solve the generic needs. Together, the tools and features can address your HA or DR requirements.\n\nDifferent tools and features provide different levels of protection.

Learn about network isolation, address prefixes, Cloud Service Endpoint source addresses, data packet flows, external IP address lifecycle, and Classic infrastructure access. Readers are expected to have some networking background.\n\n\n\n Network isolation \n\nVPC network isolation takes place at three levels:\n\n\n\n* Hypervisor - The virtual server instances are isolated by the hypervisor. A virtual server instance can't directly reach other virtual server instances that are hosted by the same hypervisor if they are not in the same VPC.\n* Network - Isolation occurs at the network level by using virtual network identifiers (VNIs). These identifiers are assigned to each subnet and scoped to a single zone. A VNI is added to all data packets that enter any zone of the VPC: entering either from the hypervisor, when sent by a virtual server instance, or entering the zone from the cloud, when sent by the implicit routing function.\n\nA packet that leaves a zone has the VNI stripped off. When the packet reaches its destination zone, entering through the implicit routing function, the implicit router always adds the proper VNI for that zone.\n* Router - The implicit router function provides isolation to each VPC by providing a virtual routing function (VRF) and a VPN with MPLS (multi-protocol label switching) in the cloud backbone. Each VPC's VRF has a unique identifier, and this isolation allows each VPC to have access to its own copy of the IPv4 address space. The MPLS VPN allows for federating all edges of the cloud: Classic Infrastructure, Direct Link, and VPC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Address prefixes \n\nAddress prefixes are the summary information that is used by a VPC's implicit routing function to locate a destination virtual server instance, regardless of the availability zone in which the destination virtual server instance is located. The primary function of address prefixes is to optimize routing over the MPLS VPN, while pathological routing cases are avoided.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-behind-the-curtain"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_15956-7-2137", "score": 16.392504, "text": "\nVPC storage service overview \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) provides block storage, file storage, and snapshots solutions to meet your cloud storage needs.

Create a VPC and subnet to define the network. When you create your subnet, attach a public gateway if you want to allow all resources in the subnet to communicate with the public internet.\n2. To limit the subnet's inbound and outbound traffic, you can configure an access control list (ACL). By default, all traffic is allowed.\n3. Create a virtual server instance. By default, a boot volume is attached to the instance. For most virtual server instances the default boot volume size is 100 GB. The default boot volume size for a z/OS virtual server instance is 250 GB.\n4. If you want more storage, create a block storage volume and attach it to your instance.\n5. To define the inbound and outbound traffic that is allowed for the instance, configure its security group.\n6. If you want your instance to be reachable from the internet, reserve and associate a floating IP address.\n7. To distribute requests over multiple instances, create a load balancer.\n8.

In fact, the user_id syntax must meet the requirements for header fields as defined in [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230section-3.2).\n\nThe built-in integrations derive the user ID in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* For Facebook integrations, the user_id property is set to the sender ID that Facebook provides in its payload.\n* For Slack integrations, the user_id property is a concatenation of the team ID, such as T09LVDR7Y, and the member ID of the user, such has W4F8K9JNF. For example: T09LVDR7YW4F8K9JNF.\n* For web chat, you can set the value of the user_id property.\n\n\n\nBilling is managed per monthly active user per service instance. If a single user interacts with assistants that are hosted by different service instances that belong to the same plan, each interaction is treated as a separate use. You are billed for the user's interaction with each service instance separately.\n\n\n\n\n\n Test activity charges \n\nTest messages that you send from the Preview button are charged. For the preview, a random user_id is generated and stored in a cookie. The multiple interactions that a single tester has with the assistant embedded in the preview are recognized as coming from a single user and are charged accordingly. If you are doing your own test, running a scripted regression test for example, use a single user_id for all of the calls within your regression test. Other uses are flagged as abuse.\n\n\n\n\n\n Handling anonymous users", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-admin-managing-plan"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13061-7483-8630", "score": 5.3852935, "text": "\nIn order to determine your current usage, you may wish to query a bucket to see bytes_used and object_count.

The provider\u2019s high-use SaaS systems, which held both patient record systems and business report apps, needed updates frequently. Yet, the provider's developers were overwhelmed with administering the hardware, network, and even the Kubernetes stack on their own. The provider also wanted to counteract increasing labor costs and a decreasing budget.\n\nThey started by containerizing their SaaS systems and putting them in the cloud. From that first step, they went from over-built hardware in a private data center to customizable compute that reduces IT operations, maintenance, and energy. To host the SaaS apps, they easily designed Kubernetes clusters to fit their CPU, RAM, and storage needs. They used IBM Cloud Pak for Data to provide the familiar analytics tools from their on-prem environment. Another factor for decreased staff costs is that IBM manages Kubernetes, so the provider can focus on delivering better customer service.\n\nAccelerated development is a key win for the IT Exec. With the move to public cloud, Developers can experiment easily with Node.js SDK, pushing changes to Development and Test systems, scaled out on separate clusters. Those pushes were automated with open toolchains and IBM Cloud\u00ae Continuous Delivery. Updates to the SaaS system no longer languished in slow, error-prone build processes.

Actions offers the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* The process of creating a conversational flow is easier. People who have expertise with customer care can write the words that your assistant says. With a simplified process anyone can build a conversation. You don't need knowledge about machine learning or programming.\n* Actions provide better visibility into the customer's interaction and satisfaction with the assistant. Because each task is discrete and has a clear beginning and ending, you can track user progress through a task and identify snags.\n* The conversation designer doesn't need to manage data collected during the conversation. By default, your assistant collects and stores information for the duration of the current action. You don't need to take extra steps to delete saved data or reset the conversation. But if you want, you can store certain types of information, such as the customer's name, for the duration of a conversation.\n* Many people can work at the same time in separate, self-contained actions. The order of actions within a conversation doesn't matter. Only the order of steps within an action matters. And the action author can use drag and drop to reorganize steps in the action for optimal flow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Dialog benefits \n\nA dialog-based conversation is the best choice when you want greater control over the logic of the flow. The dialog editor exposes more of the underlying artifacts (such as intents and entities) used to build the AI models. The dialog flow uses an if-then-else style structure that might be familiar to developers, but not to content designers or customer-care experts.\n\n\n\n\n\n How actions are different from dialog \n\nIf you are already familiar with dialog-based conversations, learn more about how actions compares.\n\n\n\nConversational flow skill feature support\nThis table has row and column headers.

You can optionally include a message that summarizes the user's issue to be provided to the human agent.

The source image file must be hosted somewhere and have a URL that you can use to reference it. It cannot be a file that is stored in a directory that is not publicly accessible.\n* Option: Adds a list of one or more options.

The team can simultaneously build a conversational flow by defining discrete actions.\n\nIf you have data scientists or team members with programming skills, you can take advantage of some advanced capabilities that require varying levels of development expertise.

Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Phone integration: If you want to deploy an assistant that uses the universal language model with the phone integration, you must connect to custom Speech service language models that can understand the language you're using. For more information about supported language models, see the [Speech to Text](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-modelsmodelsList) and [Text to Speech](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/text-to-speech?topic=text-to-speech-voiceslanguageVoices) documentation.\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-language"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02839-7-2335", "score": 14.30505, "text": "\nAdding support for global audiences \n\nYour customers come from all around the globe. You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support. Watson Assistant has built-in support for all languages. Use one of 13 language-specific models or the universal model, which adapts to any other language you want to support.\n\nWhen you build a skill that is dedicated to a language, a language-specific classifier model is used by the skill. The precision of the model means that your assistant can better understand and recognize the goals of even the most colloquial message from a customer.\n\nUse the new universal language model to create an assistant that is fluent even in languages that Watson Assistant doesn't support with built-in models.\n\nTo deploy, attach each language skill to its own assistant that you can deploy in a way that optimizes its use by your target audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n Understanding the universal language model \n\nA skill that uses the universal language model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point.

It then learns from the training data that you add to it.\n\nThe universal language classifier can adapt to a single language per skill. It cannot be used to support multiple languages within a single skill. However, you can use the universal language model in one skill to support one language, such as Russian, and in another skill to support another language, such as Hindi. The key is to add enough training examples or intent user examples in your target language to teach the model about the unique syntactic and grammatical rules of the language.\n\nUse the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available, and which is unique enough that an existing model is insufficient.\n\nFor more information about feature support in the universal language model, see [Supported languages](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-language-support).\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating a skill that uses the universal language model \n\nTo create a skill that uses the universal language model, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

You need an assistant that can talk to them in their own language and in a familiar style. Choose the approach that best fits your business needs.\n\n\n\n* Quickest solution: The simplest way to add language support is to author the conversational skill in a single language. You can translate each message that is sent to your assistant from the customer's local language to the skill language. Later you can translate each response from the skill language back to the customer's local language.\n\nThis approach simplifies the process of authoring and maintaining the conversational skill. You can build one skill and use it for all languages. However, the intention and meaning of the customer message can be lost in the translation.\n\nFor more information about webhooks you can use for translation, see [Webhook overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-webhook-overview).\n* Most precise solution: If you have the time and resources, the best user experience can be achieved when you build multiple conversational skills, one for each language that you want to support.

For example, you might create one workspace to design the type system and perform human annotation, and then create a separate workspace, perhaps in a separate instance of Knowledge Studio with different users, to train the machine learning model. Being able to upload the resources, including the ground truth created by human annotators, makes this scenario possible.\n\nYou cannot download and upload a machine learning model. Instead, you can download all of the artifacts that were used to create the model from one workspace and upload them into a new workspace. From the new workspace, you can run training again to recreate the model.

The service can spot the same keyword multiple times and report each occurrence. The service spots keywords only in the final results, not in interim results. By default, the service does no keyword spotting.\n\nTo use keyword spotting, you must specify both of the following parameters:\n\n\n\n* Use the keywords parameter to specify an array of strings to be spotted. The service spots no keywords if you omit the parameter or specify an empty array. A keyword string can include more than one token. For example, the keyword Speech to Text has three tokens. Keyword matching is case-insensitive, so Speech to Text is effectively equivalent to speech to text.\n\nFor US English, the service normalizes each keyword to match spoken versus written strings. For example, it normalizes numbers to match how they are spoken as opposed to written. For other languages, keywords must be specified as they are spoken.\n* Use the keywords_threshold parameter to specify a probability between 0.0 and 1.0 for a keyword match. The threshold indicates the lower bound for the level of confidence the service must have for a word to match the keyword. A keyword is spotted in the transcript only if its confidence is greater than or equal to the specified threshold.\n\nSpecifying a small threshold can potentially produce many matches. If you specify a threshold, you must also specify one or more keywords.

In addition to being tuned for short utterances in general, the model is also tuned for precise utterances such as digits, single-character word and name spellings, and yes-no responses.\n\nThe en-US_ShortForm_NarrowbandModel is optimal for the kinds of responses that are common to human-to-machine exchanges, such as the use case of IBM\u00ae Voice Agent with Watson\u2122.

Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands. You can optionally set up your cluster to communicate with on-prem services by setting up a VPC VPN on the private network. \n App networking You can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service for your apps in the cluster, which automatically provisions a VPC load balancer in your VPC outside the cluster. The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes.

Depending on your app's workload, set a limit for the number of pods per core, such as 10. - Avoid node overload: Similarly, just because a node can contain more than 100 pods doesn't mean that you want it to. Depending on your app's workload, set a limit for the number of pods per node, such as 40. - Don't tap out your cluster bandwidth**: Keep in mind that network bandwidth on scaling virtual machines is around 1000 Mbps. If you need hundreds of worker nodes in a cluster, split it up into multiple clusters with fewer nodes, or order bare metal nodes. - Sorting out your services: Plan out how many services that you need for your workload before you deploy. Networking and port forwarding rules are put into Iptables.

We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service.

Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users.

This capability's usefulness depends on your enterprise structure because usage data is aggregated by each account group and account. Create account groups for projects that function under a common budget. See [How can I use an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterpriseenterprise-use-cases) for examples.\n\nThe enterprise administrator or your financial officer might not be familiar with each individual account or account group. To make it easier to identify their purpose, give each account and account group a human-readable name. If your company uses billing codes, you can also incorporate them into the name. For example, instead of a devteam account group with fed ui and be api accounts, create the Development - A2B3 account group with Front-end UI team and Back-end API team accounts.\n\nAn enterprise user with Administrator or Editor access can edit the enterprise and account group names, but they can't change account names. To edit an account name, a user must be in the account itself.\n\nBecause you have a unified view of all usage that's organized by your account groups and accounts, you can charge back usage costs to the associated teams.

The enterprise account manages billing for the entire enterprise, with usage costs from all accounts that are rolled up and paid from the enterprise account.\n* Account groups, which you can use to organize related accounts. Account groups can't contain resources themselves, but you can view costs for resource usage from the accounts that they contain.\n* Accounts, which are just like stand-alone IBM Cloud accounts in that they contain resources and resource groups, Cloud Foundry orgs and spaces, and independent access permissions.

Starting at the enterprise level, you can navigate within the enterprise structure to see the estimated usage costs within each account or account group. At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts.

Similarly, users in each account can continue to view their past and current usage from the Usage page regardless of whether they have enterprise access.\n\nYou can view usage from the Usage page in the console, from the CLI, or from the Enterprise Usage Reports API.

IBM Cloudant always needs to keep the document tree structure around. This rule applies even if internal nodes in the tree are stripped of their payloads. If you find that you create long revision trees, your replication performance suffers. Moreover, if your update frequency is higher than, say, once or twice every few seconds, you\u2019re more likely to produce update conflicts.\n\nPrefer models that are immutable.\n\nWhen you read the following sections, Deleting documents doesn't delete them and Be careful with updates, they provoke an obvious question. That is, does the data set grow unbounded if my model is immutable? If you accept that deletes don\u2019t completely purge the deleted data and that updates are not updating in place in terms of data volume growth, not much difference exists. Managing data volume over time requires different techniques.\n\nThe only way to truly reclaim space is to delete databases, rather than documents. You can replicate only winning revisions to a new database and delete the old to get rid of lingering deletes and conflicts. Or perhaps you can build it into your model to regularly start new databases (say \u2018annual data\u2019) and archive off (or remove) outdated data, if your use case allows.\n\n\n\n\n\n Eventual consistency is a harsh taskmaster (also known as don\u2019t read your writes) \n\nEventual consistency is a great idea on paper, and a key contributor to IBM Cloudant\u2019s ability to scale out in practice. However, it\u2019s fair to say that the mindset required to develop against an eventually consistent data store does not feel natural to most people.\n\nYou often get stung when you write tests similar to the following ones:\n\n\n\n1. Create a database.\n2. Populate the database with some test data.\n3. Query the database for some subset of this test data.\n4. Verify that the data that you got back is the data that you expected to get back.\n\n\n\nNothing wrong with that test?

This practice significantly reduces the chance that you create conflicted documents.\n\nConversely, if you're updating a specific document less than once every 10 seconds, an update-in-place data model - that is, updating existing documents - simplifies your application code considerably.\n\nTypically, data models based on immutable data require the use of views to summarize the documents that include the current state. As views are precomputed, this process most likely doesn't adversely affect application performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/ interface is a distributed database. Within the cluster, documents are bucketed into a number of shards that collectively form the database. These shards are then distributed across nodes in the cluster. This practice allows the support of databases many terabytes in size.\n\nBy default, the database is split into shards. Each shard has three copies, or shard replicas, which reside on a different node of the database cluster.

This practice significantly reduces the chance that you create conflicted documents.\n\nConversely, if you're updating a specific document less than once every 10 seconds, an update-in-place data model - that is, updating existing documents - simplifies your application code considerably.\n\nTypically, data models based on immutable data require the use of views to summarize the documents that include the current state. As views are precomputed, this process most likely doesn't adversely affect application performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nBehind the https://$ACCOUNT.cloudant.com/ interface is a distributed database. Within the cluster, documents are bucketed into a number of shards that collectively form the database. These shards are then distributed across nodes in the cluster. This practice allows the support of databases many terabytes in size.\n\nBy default, the database is split into shards. Each shard has three copies, or shard replicas, which reside on a different node of the database cluster. Sharding allows the database to continue serving requests if a node fails, so saving a document involves writing to three nodes.

A repository that retains immutable backup files for compliance with SEC 17a-4(f) must be configured as a stand-alone backup repository as a Veeam Scale-Out backup Repository is not compliant with this rule.\n* It is recommended that the name and description attributes for the repository include the word \u201cimmutable\" when the Linux hardened repository feature is enabled.\n* To protect against the possibility of premature deletion of backup files that can result from accelerating the system time clock, Linux OS must be configured to synchronize with a secure time source. For example, with a network time protocol (NTP) clock.\n* Ensure separation of duties by assigning management of Linux hardened repositories to a team other than backup administrators.\n* Veeam recommends XFS for performance and space efficiency reasons (block cloning support). Due to the requirement for periodic full backups, means that due to fast cloning, synthetic full backups take no physical disk space, except for metadata.\n* Only backup job configurations with forward incremental with synthetic or active full are supported. Forward incremental with synthetic full is the default backup job setting.\n* For backup copy jobs, GFS must be enabled.\n* Encryption of backup files is available as follows:\n\n\n\n* When configured in a backup job, Veeam Backup and Replication can use 256-bit AES block cypher encryption.\n* For data in transit, a global network traffic rule can be configured to enable all traffic to be encrypted through 256-bit AES encryption.

You get great results from the start, and when you enable extra features like Emphasize the answer, the answers are clear and concise. However, for advanced use cases, or if you want to be able to troubleshoot issues, a Document Retrieval project type might be a better fit.\n\nTo help you choose the right Discovery project type, review the project type differences that are described in the following table.\n\n\n\nProject type details\n\n Function Conversational Search Document Retrieval \n\n Enrichment support Only the Part of Speech enrichment is applied. The Part of Speech and Entities enrichments are applied. The Entities enrichment is helpful for identifying important information and introduces more ways to filter query results. \n Testing queries from the Improve and customize page in Discovery You see only one of the responses that are returned from the chatbot. You cannot see all of the available responses and cannot analyze individual query results. You can filter query results by enrichment-based facets. You can review details about fields that are indexed in the source documents that are returned for a query. Access to more information makes it easier to troubleshoot unexpected results. \n Search triggers Returns answers from the text field automatically. If answers are stored in another field, you must change the configuration. You can apply a Smart Document Understanding (SDU) model or enrichments to your collections and retrieve useful information from fields other than text when search is triggered from the assistant. \n\n\n\nFor both project types, the best way to test is to trigger search from the Watson Assistant preview. When you configure search support for an assistant, you can fine-tune the experience in ways that aren't available in Discovery.\n\nAnd settings that are available from the Search results tool for a Document Retrieval project type are replaced by configuration settings that you specify in Watson Assistant.

Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots. Like any tool that can be used for good, bots can be used for malicious behavior, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n Differences between good bots and bad bots \n\nIt is estimated that up to half of all internet traffic is bot traffic. Some bots are malicious, and some are \"good.\"\n\nBots that misuse online products or services can be considered \"bad.\" Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.\n\nA bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt file.\n\n\n\n\n\n The robots.txt file \n\nRobots.txt is a file that outlines the rules for bots accessing properties on a web server, though the file itself does not enforce these rules. Anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.\n\n\n\n\n\n How bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-3403-5572", "score": 19.888796, "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04105-7-2225", "score": 14.373378, "text": "\nAbout bot management \n\nBot management blocks undesired or malicious internet bot traffic while allowing useful bots to access web properties. Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional.

However, the default security stance can interfere with many API calls. It is recommended that you take a few actions to prevent interference with your API traffic after proxying is active.\n\n\n\n* Turn security features off selectively, using the Page Rules features.\n\n\n\n* Create a Page Rule with the URL pattern of your API, such as api.example.com\n* Add the following rule behaviors:\n\n\n\n* Select Security Level to Essentially off\n* Select TLS to Off\n* Select Browser Integrity Check to Off\n\n\n\n* Select Provision Resource\n\n\n\n* Alternatively, you can turn off Web Application Firewall globally from the Security page.\n\n\n\n\n\n What does the Browser Integrity Check do? \n\nThe browser integrity check looks for HTTP headers that are commonly abused by spammers. It denies traffic with those headers access to your page. It also blocks visitors that do not have a user agent, or who add a non-standard user agent (this tactic is commonly used by abuse bots, crawlers, or APIs).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Best practice 4: Configure your security settings as strictly as possible \n\nCIS provides some options for encrypting your traffic. As a reverse proxy the TLS connection is terminated at Cloudflare and a new TLS connection is opened to your origin servers. For your termination with CIS, you can upload a custom certificate from your account, you can use a wildcard certificate provisioned for you by CIS, or both.\n\n\n\n Upload a custom certificate \n\nYou can upload your public and private key when you create an Enterprise domain. If you upload your own certificate, you gain immediate compatibility with encrypted traffic, and you maintain control over your certificate (for example, an Extended Validation (EV) certificate). Remember that you'll be responsible for managing your certificate if you upload a custom certificate. For example, IBM CIS won't track the certificate expiration dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n Alternatively, use a certificate provisioned by CIS \n\nIBM CIS has partnered with several Certificate Authorities (CAs) to provide domain wildcard certificates for our customers, by default. Manual verification could be required for setting up these certificates, and your support team can help you perform these additional steps.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-best-practices-for-cis-setup"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04107-9120-10897", "score": 18.215834, "text": "\nCIS WAF contains rulesets to mitigate non-volumetric attacks, including cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

In particular, if you require a record for your origin that cannot be proxied by CIS, use a non-standard name. For example, instead of ftp.example.com use [random word or-random characters].example.com. This obfuscation makes dictionary scans of your DNS records less likely to expose your origin IP addresses.\n\n\n\n\n\n Use separate IP ranges for HTTP and non-HTTP traffic if possible", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-manage-your-ibm-cis-for-optimal-security"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04177-7-2309", "score": 18.880276, "text": "\nManaging your CIS deployment \n\nYou'll begin by using the Overview screen as your working base of operations.

Bot management detects bot activity, discerns between desirable and undesirable bot behavior, and identifies the sources of the undesirable activity.\n\nUnmanaged bots can cause serious issues for web properties. Excessive bot traffic can put a heavy load on web servers, slowing or denying service to legitimate users (for example, DDoS attacks). Malicious bots can perform cyber attacks such as scraping content from websites, stealing user credentials, and spreading spam content.\n\n\n\n What bot managers do \n\nA bot manager is any software product that manages bots. Bot managers should be able to block some bots and allow others through, instead of simply blocking all non-human traffic. If all bots are blocked and Google bots aren't able to index a page, for instance, then that page can't show up in Google search results, resulting in greatly reduced organic traffic to the website.\n\nAn effective bot manager accomplishes the following goals:\n\n\n\n* Distinguishes bots from human visitors\n* Identifies bot reputation\n* Identifies bot origin IP addresses and block based on IP reputation\n* Analyzes bot behavior\n* Adds \"good\" bots to allowlists\n* Challenges potential bots with a CAPTCHA test, JavaScript injection, or other methods\n* Rate limits any potential bot that is over-using a service\n* Denies access to certain content or resources for \"bad\" bots\n* Serves alternative content to bots\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What are bots and what do they do? \n\nA bot is a computer program that automatically does certain actions on a network. The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-about-bot-mgmt"}]}

In this event, we recommend you contact IBM and provide details of your test so that that IBM can support you in the steps to resolve the problem.\n\nIt's also recommended that you try the Beta version in one of your test systems after you upgrade.

This returns a list of all models and their corresponding model_id values.\n* Language pair support: Instead of selecting a model_id, you can now specify a source and target language instead, and the model will default to the one that's trained on the general news domain.\n* JSON request body support: When making a POST translation request, you can now make the request as a JSON submission. The JSON formatting allows you to submit multiple paragraphs for translation, instead of just a single piece of text in the form submission format.\n* JSON response body support: The translation request returns support JSON formatting as well as plain text formatting. The JSON format allows support for the translated words to be returned in multiple paragraphs instead of a single piece of text.\n* Accept header support: The accept header can now be used to define the format of the response in all of the operations (text/plain or application/json).\n* Language Identification support: Language identification methods have been added to this API. This allows you to identify the language of the input texts, and lists all supported languages that can be detected by the API.\n\n\n\nNew API authentication process\n: The Language Translator service has a new API authentication process for service instances that are hosted in the following locations:\n\n\n\n* Dallas as of June 15, 2018\n* Frankfurt as of June 15, 2018\n* London\n* Seoul\n* Sydney as of June 12, 2018\n* Tokyo\n* Washington, DC as of June 12, 2018\n\n\n\nIBM Cloud is migrating to token-based Identity and Access Management (IAM) authentication.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage.

To find all FAQs for IBM Cloud, see the [FAQ library](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/faqs).\n\n\n\n What is a secret? \n\nA secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, a secret might be a username and password combination or an API key that you use while you develop your applications. To keep your applications secure, it is important to regulate which secrets can access what and who has access to them.\n\nIn addition to the static secrets described, there are other types of secrets that you might work with in the Secrets Manager service. To learn more about secret types, check out [Types of secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-what-is-secretsecret-types).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is a secret group? \n\nA secret group is a means to organize and control access to the secrets that you store within Secrets Manager. There are several different strategies that you might use to approach secret groups. For more information and recommendations, see [Best practices for organizing secrets and assigning access](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-organize-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is an IAM credential? \n\nAn IAM credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens when I rotate my secret? \n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use. You can choose to manually add a value or automatically generate one at regular intervals by enabling automatic rotation.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-faqs"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_06832-3322-5473", "score": 14.4438925, "text": "\nThe resolved value of a by CRN or by name secret reference is never exposed to the front-end and is always dynamically resolved at runtime within a toolchain and pipeline based on a permitted [authorization](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/authorizations) being available (configured using IAM Authorizations and Access Policies).\n\nWithin IBM Cloud\u00ae, the dynamic process of resolving by CRN and by name secrets references in toolchains and pipelines is performed using internal virtual private endpoints (VPE) to all IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager and IBM\u00ae Key Protect provider instances in all regions. This ensures all request and response data between toolchains, pipelines, and IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager and IBM\u00ae Key Protect provider instances is kept within the in-boundary private IBM Cloud network and does not travel over any public network channels.\n\nIn addition to manually selecting chosen secrets on a one-by-one basis from any bound secrets integrations in a toolchain, the option of using a Secret Hint is also available. This option enables a toolchain template to be predefined with suggested secrets names (also known as Hints) that are a short form secret reference. The format of a secret hint is {vault::secret-name} whereby no secret integration name is included. This provides flexibility to the toolchain author in that all required secret names can be prepopulated into a toolchain.yml and then these names are automatically resolved against whatever secrets integrations are configured for the toolchain.\n\nAs previously described, you can configure Secrets Manager to reference secrets by CRN. For more information, see [Cloud Resource Names (CRN)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-crn). This format allows for greater flexibility because you can reference secrets from an Secrets Manager instance in a different account if the correct [authorization](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/authorizations) is in place.

Do not redact the information or replace it wholesale with variables. For best results, replace the real information with fake information of the same type.\n\nFor example, if the PII that you want to protect is client names, then instead of redacting each name or replacing each name with a variable, such as USER_NAME, replace each name with a fake name that uses a variety of typical name syntax styles, such as Jane Doe, Mr. Smith, Dietrich, or Dr. Jones, PhD. Consider writing a script that concatenates a variety of first and last names, and titles and last names, and adds last names alone to create fake names that can be inserted into the document to replace instances of real user names. The goal is to simulate as closely as possible real values in the source documents. If the same text (USER_NAME) is used in the documents or text is redacted, you will basically be training the model to expect all names to have that same value or be redacted.

Object Storage is available with three types of resiliency: Cross Region, Regional, and Single Data Center. Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-satellite-architecture-about"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16729-71418-73421", "score": 19.146238, "text": "\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry provides a multi-tenant private image registry that you can use to store and share your container images with users in your IBM Cloud account.\n\nKubernetes service Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 45 minutes\n* 2023-06-02\n\n\n\n[Encrypting images for content confidentiality](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_encrypt)Encrypting images for content confidentiality\n\nYou can protect the confidentiality of your IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry images, and ensure that hosts that aren't trusted can't run the images.\n\nKey Protect Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 2 hours\n* 2023-01-25\n\n\n\n[Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-iam_access)Granting access to Container Registry resources tutorial\n\nUse this tutorial to find out how to grant access to your resources by configuring IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM) for IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry.\n\nContainer Registry\n\n\n\n* 45 minutes\n* 2023-01-31\n\n\n\n[Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor workflow tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_tutorial_workflow)Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor workflow tutorial\n\nUse this tutorial to find out about the basic functions of both IBM Cloud\u00ae Container Registry and Vulnerability Advisor.\n\nKubernetes service Container Registry\n\n\n\n* 2 hours\n* 2023-06-19\n\n\n\n[Onboarding a Certified Operator from a Red Hat registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-catalog-opbundle-tutorial)Onboarding a Certified Operator from a Red Hat registry\n\nThis tutorial walks you through how to onboard a sample Operator bundle from a Red Hat\u00ae registry to your account.

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Then, researchers and data analysts from everywhere can download data sets and do their own analysis.\n\nDevelopers started by deploying their research-sharing SaaS apps in containers with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. They created clusters for a Development environment that allow worldwide Developers to collaboratively deploy app improvements quickly.\n\nSecurity first: The Development Exec chose bare metal to host the research clusters. With bare metal for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, the sensitive research workloads now have familiar isolation but within the flexibility of public cloud. Because this nonprofit also has a partnership with pharmaceutical companies, app security is crucial. Competition is fierce, and corporate espionage is possible. From that secure core, Vulnerability Advisor provides scanning.\n\n\n\n* Image vulnerability scanning\n* Policy scanning based on ISO 27k\n\n\n\nSecured research apps lead to increased clinical trial participation.\n\nTo achieve global availability, the Dev, Test, and Production systems are deployed across the globe in several data centers. For HA, they use a combination of clusters in multiple geographic regions as well as multizone clusters. They can easily deploy the research app to Frankfurt clusters to comply with the local European regulation. They also deploy the app within the United States clusters to ensure availability and recovery locally. They also spread the research workload across multizone clusters in Frankfurt to ensure that the European app is available and also balances the workload efficiently. Because researchers are uploading sensitive data with the research-sharing app, the app\u2019s clusters are hosted in regions where stricter regulations apply.\n\nDevelopers focus on domain problems, by using existing tools: Instead of writing unique ML code, ML logic is snapped into apps, by binding IBM Cloud services to clusters. Developers are also freed up from infrastructure management tasks because IBM takes care of Kubernetes and infrastructure upgrades, security, and more.\n\nCompute, storage, and apps run in public cloud with secure access to research data across the globe, as warranted.

The user provides the desired state and Kubernetes attempts to conform to, and then maintains the described state.\n\nThis [self-paced workshop](https://ibm.github.io/kube101/) can help you to get your first hands-on experience with Kubernetes. Additionally, check out the Kubernetes [concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/) documentation page to learn more about the concepts of Kubernetes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What IBM's doing for you \n\nBy using Kubernetes clusters with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you get the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* Multiple data centers where you can deploy your clusters.\n* Support for ingress and load balancer networking options.\n* Dynamic persistent volume support.\n* Highly available, IBM-managed Kubernetes masters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Sizing clusters \n\nAs you design your cluster architecture, you want to balance costs against availability, reliability, complexity, and recovery. Kubernetes clusters in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provide architectural options based on the needs of your apps. With a bit of planning, you can get the most out of your cloud resources without over-architecting or over-spending. Even if you over or underestimate, you can easily scale up or down your cluster, by changing either the number or size of worker nodes.\n\nTo run a production app in the cloud by using Kubernetes, consider the following items:\n\n\n\n1. Do you expect traffic from a specific geographic location? If yes, select the location that is physically closest to you for best performance.\n2. How many replicas of your cluster do you want for higher availability?", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-vm-to-containers-and-kubernetes"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_04085-7-1799", "score": 15.227462, "text": "\nKubernetes \n\nThe IBM Blockchain Platform allows you to provision blockchain components into your Kubernetes cluster.

With the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service horizontal scaling, their apps scale with the growing number of records, resulting in faster regulatory reports. IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides elastic compute resources around the world that are secure and capable.\n\nNow those apps receive high-volume data from a data warehouse on IBM Cloudant. Cloud-based storage in IBM Cloudant ensures higher availability than when it was locked in an on-premises system. Since availability is essential, the apps are deployed across global data centers: for DR and for latency too.\n\nThey also accelerated their risk analysis and compliance.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

You need to ensure that your assistants are identically configured in both regions. You also need to rely on the upstream SIP trunking provider to detect and manage failing over between regions.\n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nSIP trunking providers can be configured to actively health-check the Watson Assistant session border controllers (SBCs) by sending periodic SIP OPTIONS messages to each zone within a region. A failure to receive a response from one of the zones being health-checked can be used to either provide notification of a failure to trigger a manual failover, or it can be used to automate removal of the failed zone from the route list.\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nThe SIP trunking provider plays an important role in detecting and managing a failover, especially if an automatic failover is expected between regions. In most cases, SIP trunking providers should be configured to treat each zone within a region as active/active and two regions where an assistant is configured as active/passive. SIP trunking providers should always be configured to load balance and fail over between zones within a single region. The remainder of this section focuses on handling a failover between regions.\n\n\n\n\n\n Full service outage \n\nPhone integration failures have two types. The first type is a full outage where the session border controllers in all 3 regional zones become unreachable. This is the easier of the two types to detect and handle because the SIP trunking provider is immediately notified via SIP timeouts that the call fails and can be configured to either automatically fail over or the call routing can be manually reconfigured at the SIP trunking provider to direct traffic away from the failed region towards the passive backup region. If a failover is automated and a regional backup is enabled, it is always best to try a different zone first and only redirect traffic to the passive backup region if a preconfigured number of failures occur within a short period of time. This prevents an unnecessary failover between regions if only a short outage occurs.\n\nNote that Watson Assistant provides a round-robin fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that includes the IPs for each zone in the region.

Over the course of a conversation, your customers answer questions and make choices. These customer responses are stored as variables, which your assistant can then use to guide a conversation. By choosing the right steps and not wasting your customers' time, you can get them as quickly as possible to the right solution.\n* Modularity. Some information might be useful for many different purposes (for example, a customer's current account balance or contact information). Rather than retrieving or recalculating this information in multiple locations, you can do so once, by using a variable to store the result and then access it wherever you need it.\n\n\n\nA variable is simply a named container for a piece of information; by referencing this container by name, your assistant can store or retrieve the information at run time. For example, a variable that is called account_balance might store your customer's current account balance, a value your assistant can update or retrieve as needed.\n\nThe data that is stored by a variable is characterized by the type of data that it contains, such as text, a numeric value, a date, or even a list of multiple values. The operations that you can perform with a variable vary depending on its data type.\n\n\n\n Action variables and session variables \n\nWatson Assistant supports two categories of variables:\n\n\n\n* Action variables: When a step collects information from the customer, the customer response is automatically stored in an action variable.", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-manage-info"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_13309-12597-14882", "score": 4.983579, "text": "\nFor example, accountants adhere to a common set of standards and procedures that are known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-sa-12"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_07949-17036-19108", "score": 14.12254, "text": "\nBy monitoring for risks, you can identify security vulnerabilities and quickly work to mitigate the impact and fix the issue.

Most enterprises are also faced with the challenge of protecting an ever-increasing attack surface while simultaneously maintaining compliance with industry and regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nTo protect this expanding attack surface, enterprises need continuous visibility into workloads from the start until the end of their lifecycle. Enterprises must maintain a \u201cfull-stack\u201d understanding of the workload vulnerabilities and configuration issues at the infrastructure, platform, and application level in the context of threats and compliance requirements. Enterprises need predictive analytics to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d to give a proactive view of their cyberrisk and compliance risk posture in this vast, new hybrid world.\n\nCaveonix RiskForesight\u2122 provides proactive workload protection from risks due to cyberthreats and regulatory compliance issues.

This document gives some details.\n\n\n\n  What is a Web Application Firewall? \n\nA WAF helps protect web applications by filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic between a web application and the internet. A WAF is an OSI protocol Layer-7 defense in the [OSI model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model), and it is not designed to defend against all types of attacks.\n\nDeploying a WAF in front of a web application is like placing a shield between the web application and the internet. A proxy server protects a client machine\u2019s identity by using an intermediary (for outgoing traffic), but a WAF is a type of reverse-proxy that protects the server from exposure by having the client's traffic pass through the WAF before reaching the server (for incoming traffic).\n\n\n\n\n\n  Types of attacks WAF can prevent \n\nA WAF typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others. A WAF usually is part of a suite of tools, which together can create a holistic defense against a range of attack vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\n  How a WAF works \n\nA WAF operates through a set of rules often called policies. These policies aim to protect against vulnerabilities in the application by filtering out malicious traffic.\n\nThe value of a WAF comes from the speed and ease with which its policy modifications can be implemented, thereby allowing a faster response to varying attack vectors. For example, during a [DDoS attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack), rate limiting can be implemented by modifying WAF policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n  Key benefits of a CIS WAF \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services WAF is an easy way to set up, manage, and customize security rules to protect your web applications from common web threats. See the following list for key features:\n\n\n\n*  Easy setup - The CIS WAF is part of our overall service, which takes just a few minutes to set up. After you redirect your DNS to us, you can switch on the WAF and set up the rules you need.\n*  Detailed reporting - See greater detail in the reporting, for example, threats blocked by rule/rule group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-waf-q-and-a"}]}

By scheduling automatic rotation of your secrets at regular intervals, you can reduce the likelihood of compromise and ensure that your credentials never expire.\n\nAutomatic rotation is available only for secrets that are generated by Secrets Manager. If the secret was imported initially, you must provide new secret data to rotate it. For more information, see [Manually rotating secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manual-rotation).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you get started, be sure that you have the required level of access. To rotate secrets, you need the [Writer service role or higher](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam).\n\n\n\n Supported secret types \n\nAutomatic rotation is supported for [private certificates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-certificatescreate-certificates), [public certificates](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-certificatesorder-certificates), [user credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-user-credentials) and [IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials). Depending on the type of secret, automatic rotation takes place immediately on the date and time that you set, or it might need to complete a few extra steps before a new version of the secret can be created.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

For example, { \"password\": \"\"}. Secrets Manager replaces the existing value with a randomly generated 32-character password that contains uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.\n\nA successful response returns the ID value for the secret, along with other metadata.

Credentials are service-specific and vary based on how each service defines the credentials they need to generate. A credential might contain a user name, password, host name, port, and a URL.\n\nHowever, while the contents of each credential is unique to the service that generates it, all services managed by IAM require that new credentials include an IAM Service access role. Some services might generate more data that requires parameters to be passed in. For example, a service might require you to input a language parameter to set the default language that is returned in the resource key that is generated.\n\nTo create a resource key, call the [Resource Controller API](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/resource-controller/resource-controllercreate-resource-key) as shown in the following example:\n\n\n\n* Curl\n* Java\n* Python\n* Go\n* Node", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-service_credentials&interface=ui"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02196-14110-15777", "score": 16.947914, "text": "\nTo view the credential, the user must have the IAM level access action resource-controller.credential.retrieve_all.

A metastore enables the user to see the data files in the HDFS object storage as if they are stored in tables with HMS.\n\nMetastore acts as a bridge between the schema of the table and the data files stored in object storages. HMS holds the definitions, schema, and other metadata for each table and maps the data files and directories to the table representation which is viewed by the user. Therefore, HMS is used as a storage location for the schema and tables. HMS is a metastore server that connects to the object storage to store data and keeps its related metadata on PostgreSQL.\n\nAny database with a JDBC driver can be used as a metastore. Presto makes requests through thrift protocol to HMS. The Presto instance reads and writes data to HMS. HMS supports 5 backend databases as follows. In IBM\u00ae watsonx.data, PostgreSQL database is used.\n\n\n\n*  Derby\n*  MySQL\n*  MS SQL Server\n*  Oracle\n*  PostgreSQL\n\n\n\nCurrently HMS in watsonx.data supports Iceberg table format.\n\nFollowing three modes of deployment are supported for HMS. In watsonx.data the remote mode is used.\n\n\n\n*  Embedded Metastore - Derby with singe session.\n*  Local Metastore - MySQl with multiple session accessible locally.\n*  Remote Metastore - metastore runs on its own separate JVM and accessible via thrift network APIs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "", "source": "https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watsonxdata?topic=watsonxdata-hms_overview"}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_16641-2355-3755", "score": 19.07036, "text": "\nspark.sql.catalog.lakehouse.uri = <hms-thrift-endpoint-from-watsonx.data> for example (thrift://81823aaf-8a88-4bee-a0a1-6e76a42dc833.cfjag3sf0s5o87astjo0.databases.appdomain.cloud:32683)\nspark.hive.metastore.client.auth.mode = PLAIN\nspark.hive.metastore.client.plain.username = <hms-user-from-watsonx.data> (for example, ibmlhapikey)\nspark.hive.metastore.client.plain.password = <hms-password-from-watsonx.data>\nspark.hive.metastore.use.SSL = true\nspark.hive.metastore.truststore.type = JKS\nspark.hive.metastore.truststore.path = file:///opt/ibm/jdk/lib/security/cacerts\nspark.hive.metastore.truststore.password = changeit\nShow more\n\n\n\nParameter value:\n\n\n\n* Hms-thrift-endpoint-from-watsonx.Data: Specify the credentials for watsonx.data.\n* Hms-user-from-watsonx.Data: The watsonx.data username.\n* Hms-password-from-watsonx.Data: The watsonx.data password.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring Analytics Engine instance by using Analytics Engine API \n\nTo configure your IBM Analytics Engine instance from the Analytics Engine API, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.

If it is a Plan with billing, the customer must provide credit card information when subscribing. The user can subscribe to one Plan from a specific Product. Multiple Plans within a single Product are useful in that they can fulfill similar purposes but with differing levels of performance and cost. For example, you might have a \"Demo Plan\", which makes a single API available, and a \"Full Plan\", which makes several available.\n\nAs well as controlling which APIs a customer can use, different Plans can be used to implement rate limits. A rate limit can be implemented as a default rate across an entire Plan, or for specific operations of an API within that Plan, exempting them from the Plan rate limit. Different Plans can have differing rate limits, both between operations and for the overall limit. Applying rate limits to Plans makes it easy to offer different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute.\n\nFinally, different Plans can be used to assign a billing cost. A Plan can be set as a free Plan, or as a Plan with billing. Plans with billing can be used with rate limits to set different levels of service to customers. For example, a \"Demo Plan\" might enforce a rate limit of 10 calls per minute for a cost of $5 per month, while a \"Full Plan\" might permit up to 1000 calls per minute for a cost of $20 per month.\n\nNote: Applying a rate limit at the Plan level, creates a default rate limit that applies to each operation within the Plan. If you need to set specific rate limits for specific operations, you must set them within the operations themselves and this setting overrides the setting at the Plan level.\n\nIBM API Connect also supports the implementation of multiple versions of Products. You can choose version numbers and use them to aid the development of your Products and Plans.\n\nNote: The version for a Product is distinct from the version of any APIs that are contained in the associated Plans.

Usage of services that aren't included as part of the free allowance is charged in one of the following ways:\n\nFixed charges\n: You select a plan and pay on a flat rate basis. For example, the Bare Metal Servers are charged at a flat-rate.\n\nMetered charges\n: You pay based on your runtime and service consumption. For example, with the Push service, any usage over the free monthly allowance is charged.\n\nReserved charges\n: As the account owner of a Pay As You Go account or a Subscription account, you can reserve a service instance, with a long-term commitment, for a discounted price. For example, you can reserve the standard large Db2 on Cloud offering for 12 months.\n: Some IBM Cloud services offer reserved plans. You can request a reserved plan from the IBM Cloud catalog by clicking the tile of the service. Then, select the service plan that best meets your needs.

However, tiered charges add more pricing tiers, often offering discounted charges in tiers with larger consumption. Tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\n\n\n Simple tier \n\nIn the simple tier model, the unit price is determined by the tier that the quantity of your usage falls into. The total price is your quantity that is multiplied by the unit price in that tier, for example:\n\n\n\nTable 2.

These charge show up immediately after purchase and are prorated in proportion to how many days are left in the month. Any recurring monthly fixed costs are then shown at the first of every month.\n\nThe Hourly tag signifies that resources within your account have variable costs. These resources are updated daily.\n\n\n\n\n\n Lite plans \n\nLite plans are structured as a free quota. You can work on your projects worry free, without the risk of generating an accidental bill. The quota might operate for a specific time period, for example a month, or on a one-off usage basis.

You can purchase and manage bandwidth metering for classic in two ways, through metering on individual devices, or through collective-metering when you add a device to a bandwidth pool.\n\nAll inbound and outbound bandwidth inside the IBM Cloud Classic infrastructure is unlimited and cost-free for your servers' use. Public egress bandwidth is charged on a tiered basis, with a set allocation for each month of your servers' use.\n\nBandwidth usage is measured as egress traffic on a device's public interfaces.\n\nBandwidth allocations are reserved for all public egress network usage. Devices with individual bandwidth metering and pool-based metering are all measured unless the device is ordered on the private network only.\n\nBandwidth allocation is a threshold where usage below the threshold is free or included, while usage in excess of the threshold is billed as a bandwidth overage. Bandwidth overages are billed individually per server or device, unless they participate in a bandwidth pool.\n\nDevices added to a bandwidth pool contribute both their bandwidth allocation and bandwidth usage to form aggregated totals for the pool. If the pool usage exceeds the total pool allocation, the account owner is billed a consolidated pool overage fee.\n\n\n\n About device bandwidth \n\nYou can manage each device's bandwidth allocation. When you provision certain devices, you can select the amount of bandwidth that you want to allocate to that device. For each device, you pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth allocation during a billing cycle, and receive a notification when the device is at risk of overage for the billing cycle.

You can spend any amount of the total commitment each month.\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens if I spend my entire subscription amount before my term ends? \n\nYou're required to continue paying your monthly charges until the end of your term.

To avoid overage charges, contact [IBM Cloud Sales](https://www.ibm.com/cloud?contactmodule) to sign up for a new subscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n Is there a monthly minimum amount required for Subscription accounts? \n\nYes, your subscription must have a combined minimum spending and term commitment of $100.00 USD each month for 12 months.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I cancel my Subscription account before the end of my term commitment? \n\nA subscription is a contract between you and IBM that commits you to use IBM Cloud for a specific term and spending amount.

You can use the $12,000 credit of the first term at any time during its one-year period, whether it's $6,500 the first month and $500 a month afterward or $1,000 each month. If you spend $13,000 during that time period and don't have any other active subscriptions, the extra $1,000 is billed as overage.\n\nIf you have multiple subscriptions in your account that are valid at the same time, credit is spent from the individual subscription terms according to which one expires the soonest. Adding to the previous example, you might buy a new one-year subscription, 00432100, for $750 a month that starts 1 September 2019. As users in your account use resources, credit is deducted from the first term of your existing subscription, 01234567, because it expires first.

For support subscriptions that were bought before this date, credit is available on a month-to-month basis. When you buy or renew a support subscription, any existing active support subscriptions are converted to the term-based model for the remainder of their term.\n\nFor example, you might have a support subscription for $200 per month with three months remaining.
