Since being a division winner is a guaranteed playoff berth , there have been many cases in which a team that wins a `` weak '' division either barely has a winning record or has a . 500 or losing record altogether ( such as the 2010 Seattle Seahawks ) . At the same time , since a division winner is seeded higher than the wild cards , non-division winners may end up playing a road game during Wild Card Weekend against a team with an inferior record , or may end up outright missing the playoffs .

If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat. However, do not confuse a safe room used for protection from windstorms with a room selected for shelter-in-place. They are technically different, although they serve a similar purpose. If a safe room for windstorms is above ground level and has no windows, it can also be an ideal location in which to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n6.\nHow much time do I have to get to my designated room to shelter-in-place once I hear of an attack?\n\r\nThe situation will vary, depending on the nature of the event.
