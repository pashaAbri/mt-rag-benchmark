If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat. However, do not confuse a safe room used for protection from windstorms with a room selected for shelter-in-place. They are technically different, although they serve a similar purpose. If a safe room for windstorms is above ground level and has no windows, it can also be an ideal location in which to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n6.\nHow much time do I have to get to my designated room to shelter-in-place once I hear of an attack?\n\r\nThe situation will vary, depending on the nature of the event. It is best to take immediate protective action as soon as you think there is a local emergency, or if you hear on the radio or television that you need to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n7.\nDo I need to put towels under my door? Should they be wet?\n\r\nWet towels under a door are used in cases when you are in a room from which you can not escape and a fire is on the other side. That is not the same thing as what needs to be done when you shelter-in-place.

While we can not guarantee that plastic sheeting over air vents will stop all biological, chemical, or radiological agents, it will add to the barrier of protection for your safety.\t\n\n5.\nDo I need a safe room? What is a safe room?\n\r\nA safe room, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is a room - preferably below ground - in which people can take shelter from a tornado. If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat. However, do not confuse a safe room used for protection from windstorms with a room selected for shelter-in-place. They are technically different, although they serve a similar purpose. If a safe room for windstorms is above ground level and has no windows, it can also be an ideal location in which to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n6.\nHow much time do I have to get to my designated room to shelter-in-place once I hear of an attack?\n\r\nThe situation will vary, depending on the nature of the event. It is best to take immediate protective action as soon as you think there is a local emergency, or if you hear on the radio or television that you need to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n7.\nDo I need to put towels under my door? Should they be wet?\n\r\nWet towels under a door are used in cases when you are in a room from which you can not escape and a fire is on the other side. That is not the same thing as what needs to be done when you shelter-in-place.

While the potential earthquake hazards you may experience depend upon your location, everywhere in California is considered at high risk compared to the rest of the country. There are a multitude of reasons you may or may not have prepared yourself, your home, or business for the occurrence of an earthquake. But you need to take the time to do it now.Safety TipsThe Monterey Park Fire Department provides the following information to inform the general public of what to do before, during,and after an earthquake. Earthquakes strike suddenly, violently and without warning. Identifying potential hazards ahead of time and advance planning can reduce the dangers of serious injury or loss of life from an earthquake.Checking Utilities in Damaged HomesCheck for gas leaks - If you smell gas or hear blowing or hissing noises, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a neighbor's home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional.Look for electrical system damage - If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice.Check for sewage and water lines damage - If you suspect sewage lines are damaged, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber. If water pipes are damaged, contact the water company and avoid using water from the tap. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes.\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nBefore\n\nDuring\n\nAfter\n\n \n\n \n\nServices\n\nNews\n\nCalendar\n\nSubscribe\n\nContact\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nCommunity Development\n\nEmployment\n\nLibrary\n\n \n \n\nOnline Services", "title": "Earthquake Safety | Monterey Park, CA - Official Website", "score": 15.666577, "feedback": {"relevant": {"8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1723126094}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "earthquake preparedness"}}}}}}, {"document_id": "8bb77f30210c5f4b-277-2698", "text": "Emergency Preparedness | San Bruno, CA\nHomeDepartmentsFireCommunity OutreachEmergency Preparedness\n\n\r\n\r\nEmergency Preparedness\t\n\nThe likelihood that you and your family will recover from an emergency tomorrow often depends on the planning and preparation done today.

Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands.

We\u2019ve seen lower rainfall and lower river levels and water tables\u2014conditions that made it more likely that fires could escape their intended boundaries and burn into standing Amazon rainforest.\u201d\nIt is possible to identify some understory forest fires with the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensors on the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites, but it\u2019s challenging for satellites to detect all of them because they often burn beneath dense canopy. Sensors on Landsat 8 and 9 and the Sentinel-2 satellites offer more detailed observations than VIIRS and can sometimes detect understory fires, though they pass over the Amazon basin less frequently than VIIRS.\nThe false-color image above, captured by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) sensor on Landsat 9, shows an example of several understory fires burning in densely forested areas south of Manaus. The use of the sensor\u2019s observations in the shortwave infrared makes it easier to identify fires.\n\u201cUnderstory fires are lose-lose: they degrade the value of forests and contribute to climate change,\u201d added Morton. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working as quickly as possible to get data from the SERVIR Amazon Fire Dashboard and several satellites about the location of these fires to fire brigades on the ground to support suppression efforts as quickly as possible.

Some floods develop slowly, sometimes over a period of days. But flash floods can develop quickly, sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain. Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water that carries rocks, mud, and other debris and can sweep away most things in its path. Overland flooding occurs outside a defined river or stream, such as when a levee is breached, but still can be destructive. Flooding can also occur when a dam breaks, producing effects similar to flash floods.\nBe aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appear harmless in dry weather can flood.

Climate is influenced by the movement of heat and moisture by air and ocean currents, which can affect the temperatures, precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, surface water levels, groundwater levels, and even storm events of a particular region.Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that define the Earth's global, regional and local climates. Often when we think of climate change, we think of the physical effects of climate change such as heatwaves, sea level rise, and heavy rainfall, and the impacts on communities and the environment, such as floods and droughts.Some climate change is influenced by naturally occurring changes in the Earth's temperature. For at least the last million years, the Earth has experienced natural cycles of cooling and warming, taking the Earth into ice ages and warming it up again. Each of these naturally-occurring cycles has taken approximately 100,000 years to complete.However, today's climate is changing much more rapidly because of greenhouse gas emissions released from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, wetland loss, and other human activities that are causing the Earth's average temperature to heat up much faster than it would naturally.The Greenhouse Effect, Greenhouse Gases, and Global Warming\n\n \n\nEnergy from the sun, or solar radiation, travels through space and enters the Earth's atmosphere, which forms a kind of warm blanket around the Earth. Some solar radiation remains trapped in the atmosphere under this blanket and is absorbed by land, air, and surface waters, while some solar radiation is reflected by land, ice, or clouds and escapes back out into space. When the Earth reflects the same amount of energy as it absorbs, the balance keeps the planet's average temperature fairly stable. This is called the greenhouse effect, and is essential for sustaining life on Earth. The revolution of the Earth around the sun and the tilt of the Earth on its axis create variation in the intensity of solar radiation received by different sections of the planet and drive naturally occurring cycles of planetary cooling and warming. This variation over time is what sends the Earth into ice ages and then into shorter warming periods between these ice ages.", "title": "Climate Change - NYSDEC", "score": 13.521782, "feedback": {"relevant": {"8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1723132014}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "Is climate change the cause of natural disasters?"}}}}}}, {"document_id": "28f6abec5bb810ba-6980-9294", "text": "Climate Change - NYSDEC\nWhen the Earth reflects the same amount of energy as it absorbs, the balance keeps the planet's average temperature fairly stable.

This variation over time is what sends the Earth into ice ages and then into shorter warming periods between these ice ages. However, these natural climate cycles can be disrupted by conditions that cause an excessive amount of solar radiation to get trapped in the Earth's atmosphere and throw off the natural balance.Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20), that are naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere in small amounts and help form the atmospheric blanket at the ideal thickness. CO2 is vital for plants to carry out photosynthesis and produce oxygen for humans and animals to breathe. When excess GHGs are generated by human activities and accumulate in the atmosphere, they increase the thickness of the atmospheric blanket, trapping solar radiation in the Earth's atmosphere. GHGs absorb and transmit that radiation back to Earth as heat. The more GHGs accumulate in the atmosphere, the thicker the blanket becomes, trapping more heat inside and creating global warming.Global warming causes the Earth's land and oceans to absorb heat energy and warm more quickly than would happen naturally. Global warming is made worse by the melting of polar ice and glaciers. Because of the albedo effect, light-colored snow and ice act as mirrors to reflect solar radiation back out into space. As ice sheets and glaciers melt with increased global warming, reducing the amount of ice and snow covering, less of the solar radiation is reflected and more is absorbed into the darker ocean waters, creating a vicious cycle that warms the planet even more and melts even more polar ice and glaciers.Global warming has been rapidly accelerating in recent decades due to excess emissions of GHGs from human activities, especially burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.", "title": "Climate Change - NYSDEC", "score": 13.055939, "feedback": {"relevant": {"8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1723132011}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "Is climate change the cause of natural disasters?"}}}}}}], "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "\"What are the sheltered rooms designated for use?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c", "created_at": 1723122998}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "A safe room, as defined by FEMA, is designed to provide shelter from tornadoes.

It\u2019s in the ground, forms big oceans, and it\u2019s in our atmosphere.\nIt\u2019s also in living things. Your body is made up mostly of water.\nWater covers 71 percent of Earth\u2019s surface. And almost all of it\u201496.5 percent\u2014is salt water. \nSalt water has different kinds of salt in it, but it mostly has sodium chloride, the same salt we add to our food.\nJust 3.5 percent of the water on Earth is fresh water we can drink. And most of that fresh water, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers.\nA third of the fresh water is in the ground. We call it groundwater. The last two percent of fresh water is in the rivers, lakes, and streams.\nA very small amount is in our atmosphere, where it exists as water vapor. That\u2019s what clouds are made of.\nIf you took all the water on Earth and put it together it would be a ball 860 miles wide.

The\r\nactivation of the TMDL program in the 1990s, in part instigated by lawsuits against the federal government to enforce the TMDL requirements, provides a\r\nplanning framework to address these problems.\nCurrent State List of Impaired Water Bodies.

The use of toxic chemical pesticides or neglecting vehicular maintenance, can further pollute our water supply. These substances inevitably end up in our waterways, contaminating local lakes, rivers, streams and the ocean. Thankfully, there are simple steps all of us can take to reduce stormwater pollution and help keep our water clean.\nCalifornians can positively impact the environment by taking necessary steps to minimize contributions to water pollution. The \u201cLet\u2019s Change This to That\u201d campaign via CleanWaterCA.com\u00a0provides a list of tips to help support clean water from summer to winter and all year round. They include:\nPick up after your pet. A common misconception is that pet waste is a natural fertilizer and can be left to decompose in the environment. Not so! Pet waste can contain harmful bacteria such as E. coli and fecal coliform, which can carry diseases that affect wildlife and contaminate waterways when not properly disposed of.\nSave water. Reduce water pollution by sweeping your driveway instead of using the hose and, if you can, by washing your car at a facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency warns that washing cars and driveways at home can cause pollution as metals and fluids are washed off and enter storm drains, collecting more pollutants along the way and ending up in our waterways. If you can, choose car wash facilities that use advanced filtration systems to recycle water used for washing cars.\nGo organic. This summer consider using natural pest control methods instead of harmful pesticides. Pesticides made from highly toxic chemicals can have long-lasting effects on the health of our water and the environment. By choosing organic alternatives, like companion planting or using beneficial insects like ladybugs, you can make a difference.\nGive your vehicle a tune-up.

Probably fairly easy as usually you can go to commercial banks or go to an investment bank if you're raising enough debt. Companies borrow all of the time, they're constantly paying off loans or taking new ones with different interest rates. There are revolving lines of credit, secured loans, factoring (borrowing against receivables), EETCs, fixed interest debt, variable interest debt, mezzanine debt, etc etc. How easy is it to issue equity?

You can purchase a used car warranty, but they are expensive, and often come with (different) problems. Finance Terms - A buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle. And you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges, so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs. Own versus Rent - You are assuming that people actually want to 'own' their cars. And I would suggest that people want to 'own' their car until it begins to present problems (repair and maintenance issues), and then they want a new vehicle to replace it. But renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive, and less flexible means to obtain transportation. Expense Allocation - A vehicle is an expense. As the owner of a vehicle, you are willing to pay for that expense, to fill your need for transportation. Paying for the product as you use the product makes sense, and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product, and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle. Capital Allocation - A buyer may need a vehicle (either to commute to work, school, doctor, or for work or business), but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase. Vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend, so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts (credit cards, loans). The buyer may not have savings, but be able to obtain financing to solve that need. Remember, people need transportation. And they are willing to pay to fill their need.

You really want to understand a little of the statistics before you can make a generic call, but my rule of thumb is that insurance via \"\"extended warranty\"\" is rarely a good deal. Here is a simple expected value math formula you can apply (when the > is true, then you should buy it): replacement cost x likelihood of using warranty % > cost of insurance You can then back-compute, what is the likelihood that I'd need to lose this item to break even? Given your numbers: $2000 x Y > $350 or Y > (350/2000) or Y > 17.5% So if you think there is a 17.5% or greater chance that you'll need to have you system replaced (i.e. not just a simple fix) AND (as Scott pointed out) you'll be able to actually use the replacement warranty then the applecare is a good purchase. Note, this only applies to items you can replace out-of-pocket without significant burden, because if you didn't have the $10k to replace your car, it wouldn't matter if the insurance wasn't such a good deal (especially if you need the car to get to work, etc.) So the obvious question is: \"\"Why would a for-profit company ever offer insurance on something they are statistically likely to lose money on?\"\" The obvious answer is \"\"they wouldn't,\"\" but that doesn't mean you should never buy this type of insurance, because you may have statistically significant circumstances. For instance, I purchased a $40 remote helicopter as a gift for my children. I also paid the $5 for a \"\"no questions asked\"\" warranty on it because, knowing my kids, I knew there was a nearly 100% chance they would break it at least once. In this case, this warranty was well worth the $5, because they did break it!

On each flyby, a suite of science instruments will gather data on how deep the subsurface ocean is, how thick the ice crust is, and, potentially, the characteristics of any plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. The goal is to find out whether Europa has the potential to support life.\nThe series\u2019 premiere episode features Europa Clipper Project Manager Jordan Evans, who also has worked on NASA\u2019s Curiosity Mars rover and the agency\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope. In the video, he joins Deputy Science Manager Trina Ray, who worked on NASA\u2019s Cassini and Galileo missions. They venture into JPL\u2019s storied High Bay 1 clean room, where the Europa Clipper spacecraft is under construction \u2013 and where all of NASA\u2019s Mars rovers, the twin Voyager spacecraft, and other historic spacecraft were assembled.\nWhile you\u2019re digging into the nuts and bolts of the spacecraft, check out a 24-hour live feed of assembly in progress in High Bay 1.\nAdditional episodes of \u201cSpacecraft Makers\u201d will include more activity inside other clean rooms where components of Europa Clipper are coming together.

Europa Clipper\u2019s components also need to be mutually compatible with one another while being operated. Given that, the testing and performance verification is designed to reflect \u201cflying conditions\u201d as well as possible. Let\u2019s look at two subsystems whose fabrication is underway.\n\nNASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) engineers align the upper and lower cylinders of Europa Clipper\u2019s propulsion module for a fit check.

While this is a large amount and a critically important capability, it represents about five percent of the velocity change needed to accomplish this mission. The bulk of the velocity change necessary to adjust trajectories once in Jupiter orbit will come from gravitational flybys of Jovian moons as planned.

The LOWEST amount a seller would accept is the liquidation value. For a B&B, what would the value of the land, the house, the furnishings, accounts payable, etc. be if it had to be sold today, minus any liabilities.  The amount the seller would like to pay for is going to be a multiple of its annual earnings. One example of this is the discounted cash flow analysis. You determine the EBITDA, the earnings a company generated, before interest,  depreciation, taxation and amortization.  Once you have this amount, you can project it out in perpetuity, or you use an industry multiplier.  Perpetuity:  You project this value out in perpituity, discounted by the going interest rate. In other words, if you project the business will earn $100,000/year, the business should grow at a 5% rate, and the going interest rate is 8%. Using a growing perpetuity formula, one value of a business would be: 100,000 / (.08 - .03) = $2,000,000.  This is a very high number, and the seller would love to get it.  It's more common to do a multiple of the EBIDTA. You can do some research into the valuation of the particular industry to figure out the EBIDTA multiplier for the industry. For example, this article suggests that the 2011 EBITDA multiplier for hospitality industries is 13.8. (It's valuing large hotel chains, but it's a start). So the value of this B&B would be around $1,380,000. Here is an online SME valuation tool to help with the EBIDTA multiple based valuation. Also, from my research, it looks like many small business use Seller Discretionary Earnings  (SDE) instead of EBITDA. I don't know much about it, but it seems to serve a similar purpose as EBITDA.  A potential buyer should request the financial statements of the business for the last few years to determine the value of the business, and then can negotiate with the owner a price.

Your safest bet is to grow organically. This means having a business model with negligible start-up costs and little overhead costs.

Also, the classic figure of 9/10 businesses failed - \"\"failed\"\" here is a very dramatic word, implying that the entrepreneur lost his or her shirt. Often it's not a case that the business lost them money - they pissed away thousands on rent or wages or misplaced marketing - but more that it made a bit of money, but not enough, so they moved on to something else. That something else might be regular employment for some people, but there are *plenty* of entrepreneurs - perhaps some of the greatest and most famous ones - who have gone on from one failure to a much bigger success.\"", "score": 13.818172, "feedback": {"relevant": {"fd309ff8-8b41-49a0-b483-2fee97472e71": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1724058798}}}, "query": {"query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "What could be the reason that most small business fail along the way?"}}}}}}}], "input": [{"speaker": "user", "text": "What approaches are there for pricing a small business?", "metadata": {"author_type": "human", "author_id": "fd309ff8-8b41-49a0-b483-2fee97472e71", "created_at": 1724057580}}, {"speaker": "agent", "text": "      One approach is to determine the lowest amount a seller would accept, which is the liquidation value.

Is this right? Pretty much, though this is a really rudimentary way to think about it. (2). If it is, why is it that extensive services are provided by high margin companies competing for talent, rather then lower margin businesses looking to boost their profits by reducing their expenditures on employees (by cutting out the government)? It's the polar opposite of that. Google (and companies like that) do things like have a day care center on premises. The company staffs a day care center which has costs, then lets employees use it for free. This is a business expense for Google, and in relative terms, a considerably large business expense that a lower margin business could no afford. Employer healthcare is a tax protected expense for employees via section 125 of the tax code. The company portion of the healthcare costs are a deductible business expense to the company, as expected. Healthcare is different than most other expenses because the employee can forego income before it's effectively received which negates it from taxable income. This doesn't work for something like food purchased at a cafe on a Google complex. If employee money is being spent at a corporate cafe, it's taxable income being spent (though the cost of running the cafe is a tax deductible business expense to the company). There have been discussions in congress to assess a value as income to employees for services like on site child care and no cost employee cafeterias. To address your new example: For example, suppose John Doe makes $100,000 a year taxed at a rate of 20%, for a take home pay of $80,000. He spends $10,000 on food. His employer Corporation decides to give him all of his food and deduct it as a business expense - costing them $10,000. But now they can pay John Doe an amount so his take home pay will be reduced by $10,000 - $87,500 The company is now spending $97500 employing John Doe, for a savings of $2500$.

Salary: The obvious one, what they pay you. Taxes: There are several taxes that an employer has to pay for the privilege of hiring someone, including social security taxes (which goes to your retirement), unemployment insurance tax (your unemployment benefits if they lay you off), and workers compensation tax (pays if you are injured on the job). (There may be other taxes that I'm not thinking of, but in any case those are the main ones.) Benefits: In the U.S. employers often pay for medical insurance, sometimes for dental, life, and disability. There's usually some sort of retirement plan. They expect to give you some number of vacation days, holidays, and sick days where they pay you even though you're not working. Companies sometimes offer other benefits, like discounts on buying company products, membership in health clubs, etc. Capital: Often the company has to provide you with some sort of equipment, like a computer; furniture, like a chair and desk; etc. As far as the company is concerned, all of the above are part of the cost of having you as an employee. If they would pay a domestic employee $60,000 in salary and $20,000 in taxes, then assuming the same benefits and capital investment, if a foreign employee would cost them $0 in taxes they should logically be willing to pay $80,000. Any big company will have accountants who figure out the total cost of a new employee in excruciating detail, and they will likely be totally rational about this. A smaller company might think, \"\"well, taxes don't really count ...\"\" This is irrational but people are not always rational. I don't know what benefits they are offering you, if any, and what equipment they will provide you with, if any. I also don't know what taxes, if any, a U.S. company has to pay when hiring a remote employee in a foreign country. If anybody on here knows the answer to that, please chime in.

Alternatively, you can use an industry multiplier to multiply the business's EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) by a factor common in the industry. From the documents, it appears that the 2011 EBITDA multiplier for hospitality industries is 13.8. and in the end for small business in most sectors you can use a rule of thumb, 2x net + FFE.

For example, German bonds have been considered safer than Greek bonds recently based on the underlying strength of the government. Unlike Cash Equivalents, these are not guaranteed against loss, which means that if the issuer defaults, you could lose up to 100% of your investment. Bonds have several new features you will need to consider. One is interest rate risk. One reason bonds perform better than cash equivalents is that you are taking on the risk that if interest rates rise, the fixed payments the bond promises will be worth less, and the face value of your bond will fall. While most bonds are still very Liquid, this means that if you need to sell the bond before it matures, you could lose money. As mentioned earlier, some bonds are riskier than others.

When you buy one share of stock, you own a (typically infinitesimal) percentage of the company. You are usually entitled to a share of the profits of that company, and/or to participate in the business decisions of that company. A particular type of stock may or may not pay dividends, which is the primary way companies share profits with their stockholders (the other way is simply by increasing the company's share value by being successful and thus desirable to investors). A stock also may or may not allow you to vote on company business; you may hear about companies buying 20% or 30% \"\"interests\"\" in other companies; they own that percentage of the company, and their vote on company matters is given that same weight in the total voting pool. Typically, a company offers two levels of stocks: \"\"Common\"\" stock usually has voting rights attached, and may pay dividends. \"\"Preferred\"\" stock usually gives up the voting rights, but pays a higher dividend percentage (maybe double or triple that of common stock) and may have payment guarantees (if a promised dividend is missed in one quarter and then paid in the next, the preferred stockholders get their dividend for the past and present quarters before the common shareholders see a penny). Governments and non-profits are typically prohibited from selling their equity; if a government sold stock it would basically be taxing everyone and then paying back stockholders, while non-profit organizations have no profits to pay out as dividends.

There can be multiple classes of shares, but to simplify, assuming only one class of shares, a company issues some number of shares, let's say 1,000,000 shares and you can buy shares of the company. If you own 1,000 shares in this example, you would own one one-thousandth of the company.  Public companies have their shares traded on the open market and the price varies as demand for the stock comes and goes relative to people willing to sell their shares. You typically buy stock in a company because you believe the company is going to prosper into the future and thus the value of its stock should rise in the open market. A bond is an indebted interest in a company.  A company issues bonds to borrow money at an interest rate specified in the bond issuance and makes periodic payments of principal and interest.  You buy bonds in a company to lend the company money at an interest rate specified in the bond because you believe the company will be able to repay the debt per the terms of the bond.  The value of a bond as traded on the open exchange varies as the prevailing interest rates vary.  If you buy a bond for $1,000 yielding 5% interest and interest rates go up to 10%, the value of your bond in the open market goes down so that the payment terms of 5% on $1,000 matches hypothetical terms of 10% on a lesser principal amount.  Whatever lesser principal amount at the new rate would lead to the same payment terms determines the new market value.   Alternatively, if interest rates go down, the current value of your bond increases on the open market to make it appear as if it is yielding a lower rate. Regardless of the market value, the company continues to pay interest on the original debt per its terms, so you can always hold onto a bond and get the original promised interest as long as the company does not go bankrupt. So in summary, bonds tend to be a safer investment that offers less potential return.

The legal fees will be subtracted from the retainer. If the retainer starts to run out, you may need to add more money.\n\nContingency fee\nYou pay the lawyer from the money you receive if you win the case or settle it out of court. If you lose, the lawyer does not receive a fee.\n\nStatutory fee\nThe cost is set by law\n\nThe lawyer will also charge you for the costs of your case (filing fees, copying expenses, expert fees). You will be responsible for paying these costs even if your case is not successful. Costs can add up quickly. It is a good idea to ask the lawyer for a written estimate of what the costs will be.\n\n Handling problems with a lawyer\n\n If you have questions or concerns about your case, first talk to your lawyer.\u00a0If you are having serious problems with your lawyer and have been unable to resolve them, there are other things you can do.\nThe State Bar also has a lot of information about what to do if you are having problems with your lawyer.\n\n \n\nWas this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\ndid this information help you with your case?\n\nGreat!", "title": "Hire a lawyer | California Courts | Self Help Guide", "score": 10.580755, "feedback": {"relevant": {"8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1723019199}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "lawyer's explanation"}}}}}}, {"document_id": "fb227e01016a7dc9-3160-5132", "text": "Hire a lawyer | California Courts | Self Help Guide\nWhen you meet with a lawyer, ask them questions to make sure you know what the lawyer will do for you and how much it will cost.

By default, these hardcoded phrases are specified in English, but you can apply a different language by adding lines to the embedded web chat script.\n\nThe hardcoded phrases used by the web chat widget are specified in language pack files. The web chat provides language packs that contain translations of each English-language phrase that is used by the web chat. You can instruct the web chat to use one of these other languages files by using the instance.updateLanguagePack() method.\n\nLikewise, the web chat applies an American English locale to content that is added by the web chat unless you specify something else.

To apply the appropriate syntax to dates and times and to use a translation of the English-language phrases, set the locale. Use the instance.updateLocale() method.\n\nFor example, if you apply the Spanish locale (es), the web chat uses Spanish-language phrases that are listed in the es.json file, and uses the DD-MM-YYYY format for dates instead of MM-DD-YYYY.\n\nThe locale you specify for the web chat does not impact the syntax of dates and times that are returned by the underlying skill.\n2.

A developer can customize the web chat to add even more capabilities.\n\n\n\n Why use the web chat? \n\nBuilding a custom user interface requires spending time and effort solving typical UI problems. For example, you need to design the layout and styling, keep up with browser changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and comply with accessibility requirements. The time you spend building and maintaining a custom UI is better spent building a high-quality assistant instead.\n\nThe web chat widget uses cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research to engage your users when they need help, answer their questions quickly and efficiently, and provide fallback options so there is always a path to a solution.

However, there are still potential security exposures that you might need to protect against. By enabling the web chat security feature and updating your website code appropriately, you can add the following protections:\n\n\n\n* You can prevent unauthorized websites from sending messages to your assistant, even if they copy your web chat embed script. (The unique identifiers in the embed script, such as the integration ID and service instance ID, are visible to anyone who has access to your website.)\n* You can securely authenticate customers in order to control access to features of your assistant that require authorization.\n* You can encrypt sensistive data so that customers cannot see it, while still allowing your assistant to access it.\n\n\n\nWeb chat security uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs), which are data objects that are sent with each message from your website to the Watson Assistant service. Because a JWT is digitally signed using a private encryption key that only you have, it ensures that each message originates with your website. The JWT payload can also be used to securely authenticate users and carry encrypted private data.\n\nFor detailed information about JSON Web Tokens, see the [JWT specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)).\n\nEnabling web chat security involves making the following customizations:\n\n\n\n* Implementing web application server code that generates a JWT signed with your private encryption key\n* Customizing the web chat configuration to provide the generated JWT\n* Enabling security in the web chat security settings\n\nAfter you enable web chat security, any message received by the web chat integration that is not accompanied by a properly signed JWT will be rejected.\n\n\n\nFor detailed information about how to complete these steps, see [Enabling web chat security](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-web-chat-security-enable).", "score": 16.305052, "feedback": {"relevant": {"e9255f72-ebe6-4594-9710-44e51f04c3fc": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1723256347}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "Enable security"}}}}}}, {"document_id": "ibmcld_02855-27616-29462", "text": "\nreturn new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n// And then pass the new JWT into the callback and the service will resume processing messages.\nevent.identityToken = 'YOUR NEW JWT';\nresolve();\n});\n}});\ninstance.render();\n}\n};\nsetTimeout(function(){\nconst t=document.createElement('script');\nt.src=\"https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.appdomain.cloud/loadWatsonAssistantChat.js\";\ndocument.head.appendChild(t);\n});\n</script>\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Passing sensitive data \n\nYou can optionally copy the public key that is provided by IBM, and use it to add an additional level of encryption to support passing sensitive data from the web chat.\n\nUse this method to send sensitive information in messages that come from your website, such as a information about a customer's loyalty level, a user ID, or security tokens to use in webhooks that you call from your dialog. Information that is passed to your assistant in this way is stored in a private variable in your assistant. Private variables cannot be seen by customers and are never sent back to the web chat.\n\nFor example, you might start a business process for a VIP customer that is different from the process you start for less important customers. You likely do not want non-VIPs to know that they are categorized as such. But you must pass this informataion to your dialog because it changes the route of the conversation. You can pass the customer MVP status as an encrypted variable. This private context variable will be available for use by the dialog, but not by anything else.\n\n\n\n1. From the web chat configuration page, copy the public key from the IBM provided public key field.\n2.

When the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned, with the Sun and Moon on opposite sides of the Earth, we see a full moon. When the Moon is positioned between the Earth and the Sun, we see a new moon. The crescent and gibbous shapes occur during the intervals between these principal phases, when only a portion of the Moon's surface is illuminated. The specific shape at any given time depends on the Moon's position in its orbit.
