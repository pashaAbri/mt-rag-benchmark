If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat. However, do not confuse a safe room used for protection from windstorms with a room selected for shelter-in-place. They are technically different, although they serve a similar purpose. If a safe room for windstorms is above ground level and has no windows, it can also be an ideal location in which to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n6.\nHow much time do I have to get to my designated room to shelter-in-place once I hear of an attack?\n\r\nThe situation will vary, depending on the nature of the event. It is best to take immediate protective action as soon as you think there is a local emergency, or if you hear on the radio or television that you need to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n7.\nDo I need to put towels under my door? Should they be wet?\n\r\nWet towels under a door are used in cases when you are in a room from which you can not escape and a fire is on the other side. That is not the same thing as what needs to be done when you shelter-in-place. See the instructions on shelter-in-place on the Red Cross website.\t\n\n8.\nIf I seal off my rooms and vents, how will I breathe? How long should I anticipate being in the room in which I am sheltering-in-place?\n\r\nInstructions to shelter-in-place are usually provided for a matter of hours, not weeks. There is little danger that the room in which you are taking shelter will run out of oxygen and you will suffocate.\t\n\n9.\nIs the bathroom a good room in which to shelter-in-place?", "title": "FAQs \u2022 Dublin \u2022 CivicEngage", "score": 13.665409, "feedback": {"relevant": {"8c34bdda-13ea-46d5-8480-de474a5d3b4c": {"value": "yes", "timestamp": 1723123788}}}, "query": {"bool": {"must": {"text_expansion": {"ml.tokens": {"model_id": ".elser_model_1", "model_text": "|user|: \"What are the sheltered rooms designated for use?"}}}}}}, {"document_id": "7d4d64e7f6aff125-3194-5132", "text": "FAQs \u2022 Disaster Preparedness\nIt is intended to provide a barrier to air flow. While we can not guarantee that plastic sheeting over air vents will stop all biological, chemical, or radiological agents, it will add to the barrier of protection for your safety.\t\n\n5.\nDo I need a safe room? What is a safe room?\n\r\nA safe room, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is a room - preferably below ground - in which people can take shelter from a tornado. If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat. However, do not confuse a safe room used for protection from windstorms with a room selected for shelter-in-place. They are technically different, although they serve a similar purpose. If a safe room for windstorms is above ground level and has no windows, it can also be an ideal location in which to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n6.\nHow much time do I have to get to my designated room to shelter-in-place once I hear of an attack?\n\r\nThe situation will vary, depending on the nature of the event. It is best to take immediate protective action as soon as you think there is a local emergency, or if you hear on the radio or television that you need to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n7.\nDo I need to put towels under my door? Should they be wet?\n\r\nWet towels under a door are used in cases when you are in a room from which you can not escape and a fire is on the other side. That is not the same thing as what needs to be done when you shelter-in-place. See the instructions on shelter-in-place on the Red Cross website.\t\n\n8.\nIf I seal off my rooms and vents, how will I breathe?
