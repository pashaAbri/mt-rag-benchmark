Compliance: Immutable Object Storage can help organizations comply with certain regulations like SEC Rule 17a-4(f), FINRA Rule 4511(c), and CFTC Rule 1.31(c)-(d) that govern electronic records storage and retention.

Irreversible: Once permanent retention is enabled, it can't be reversed. Objects uploaded that use a permanent retention period cannot be deleted.
