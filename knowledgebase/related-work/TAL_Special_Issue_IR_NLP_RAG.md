## Description

RAG has emerged as a powerful framework that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generative models, enabling systems to generate more accurate, contextually relevant, and factually grounded responses. Alongside RAG, this special issue also welcomes research on broader IR and NLP themes, such as conversational search, question answering, and knowledge-intensive tasks, to provide a comprehensive view of the field.

## Current Challenges in RAG Systems

Despite their growing prominence, RAG systems face several limitations requiring exploration and improvement:

- **Scalability bottlenecks** when indexing and querying ever-larger corpora
- **Bias amplification** from retrieval sources
- **Misleading or incorrect responses** when retrieved evidence is insufficient or poorly aligned
- **Explainability and transparency** throughout the two-stage retrieval-generation pipeline
- **Multimodal integration** challenges with text, images, audio, video, and structured knowledge (e.g., knowledge graphs)
- **Evaluation difficulties** requiring robust benchmarks and metrics that capture factuality, relevance, and efficiency for end-to-end systems and individual components (retriever, reranker, generator)

## Topics of Interest

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), including Knowledge-Intensive Tasks
- Theoretical frameworks, models, and architectures for RAG
- Evaluation metrics, benchmarks, and datasets for RAG systems
- Applications of RAG in NLP tasks (e.g., question answering, summarization, fact-checking, and information verification)
- Handling noisy or incomplete retrieval data in RAG systems
- Scalability, efficiency, and real-time performance of RAG models
- Domain-specific applications (e.g., healthcare, legal, education)
- Multimodal approaches combining text, images, audio, and video

### 2. Conversational Search and Dialogue Systems
- Dialogue management, context modeling, and query reformulation
- Personalization and user modeling for conversational search
- Multi-turn interactions and task completion in conversational systems
- Voice assistants, chatbots, and conversational agents for search
- Handling ambiguity, incomplete queries, and user intent in conversational search
- Domain-specific applications (e.g., healthcare, legal, education)
- Multimodal approaches combining text, images, audio, and video

### 3. Human-AI Collaboration and Explainability
- User studies and human-in-the-loop approaches

## Relevance to MT-RAG Benchmark

This special issue is highly relevant to our multi-turn RAG benchmark project, as it:
- Focuses on conversational search and multi-turn interactions
- Addresses evaluation metrics and benchmarks for RAG systems
- Emphasizes the challenges of context modeling and query reformulation
- Explores knowledge-intensive tasks and question answering
- Considers the importance of robust evaluation for retrieval-generation pipelines
