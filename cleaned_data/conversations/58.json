Single Metric Alert: You can define an alert based on a single metric, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, or network traffic. For instance, you can create an alert that notifies you when the average CPU usage on a monitored system exceeds 80% over a 5-minute period.\n2. Multi-Condition Alert: You can define an alert that is triggered based on multiple conditions. For example, you can create an alert that notifies you when both the average CPU usage and the average memory utilization on a monitored system exceed their respective thresholds (e.g., 80% and 70%) within a 5-minute period.\n3. Complex Conditions Alert: You can define an alert using complex conditions, such as a combination of boolean logic and metric comparisons. For instance, you can create an alert that notifies you when either the average CPU usage or the average memory utilization on a monitored system exceeds its threshold, but only if the other metric is below its threshold.\n4. Predefined Alerts: IBM Cloud Monitoring provides predefined alerts for common use cases, such as high disk usage, low available memory, or network connectivity issues. You can enable these alerts directly from the Alerts section in the web UI.\n5. Custom Alerts: You can create custom alerts tailored to your specific needs by defining the conditions, notification channels, and severity levels. These alerts can be created in the web UI or programmatically using the IBM Cloud Monitoring API.\nRemember that when creating an alert, you must define the condition that triggers the notification, the severity level, and the notification channels. By default, the severity level is set to 'warning', but you can change it to any of the following values: emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, informational, or debug."

This status informs you about the criticality of the information it reports on.

Name the alert \n\nEnter a name for the alert.\n\nYou can also add a description for the alert and the name of an alert group if you want to group you alerts.

You can choose from predefined periods such as a single day, a week, a month, or a quarter, or create custom time periods. The data points on the graph will adjust to an appropriate measurement period for the selected time frame.

Additionally, you can use the Refresh data option to ensure the data is up-to-date.\n|user|: some example of alerts\n|assistant|: Sure, here's an example of detail alerts: - Name: Enter a name for the alert (e.g., 'High CPU Usage'). - Description: Add a description for more context (optional). - Group: Specify the alert group (or use the default group). - Severity: Set the level of criticality (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low', or 'Info'). - Metric: Configure the metric you want to monitor (e.g., 'CPU usage'). - Scope: Configure the scope (e.g., specific resources, resource groups, or cloud accounts). - Trigger: Define the condition and threshold value that must be evaluated. For instance, you can set an alert to trigger when CPU usage exceeds 80% for at least 5 minutes. - Notification Channel: Enable 1 or more notification channels to receive alert notifications.

To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected.

The provided document mentions a feature called \"web chat\" that has an \"onError listening feature\" to detect specific types of outage errors. This suggests that there is some level of monitoring in place for web chat conversations. However, the document does not provide detailed information about the extent or nature of this monitoring. For more specific information, it would be necessary to refer to the documentation or contact IBM.\nRegarding the monitoring of metrics, the document explains how to compare metrics for different periods using the Time period control and how to configure alerts based on specific metric conditions.

The resources can be the number of API calls, the number of instances, memory, or storage. In addition, tiered pricing is offered in simple, graduated, or block.\n\nIBM Cloud provides detailed [cost estimators](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-cost) to help you plan for charges.\n\nAfter you build your resources, you can check the actual cost. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Billing and usage, and select Usage. With an IBM Cloud billable account, you're charged for the compute, containers, and services that your organization used. You might be invited by other IBM Cloud users to participate in organizations under a different account. The usage of the apps or services that you use in the organizations that you're invited to are charged to the account that contains those organizations. You can see more information about a specific charge from each resource details page.\n\nDifferent types of charges apply depending on the features of IBM Cloud that you're using. The following table provides a high-level overview:\n\n\n\nTable 1. Charges based on features\n\n Type of Charge Description Resource Type Example \n\n Fixed Fixed-rate pricing is based on an agreed upon monthly charge. If you buy an additional bare metal server, virtual server, or storage resource after the start of the monthly billing period, the cost of the resource for the first month is prorated based on the number of days remaining in the billing period. The prorated cost is billed in a separate invoice. Services For Bare Metal Servers, there are fixed plans to choose from, and those plans are charged at a fixed monthly rate. \n Metered Usage is a unit-based pricing model in which you pay for what you consume. In this case, the number of GB hours that are consumed for runtimes and the number of IP addresses and storage that is consumed for containers. Services, Compute, and Containers For Push Notifications, any usage that is consumed over the free monthly allowance of 100,000 digital messages per month, will be charged.",

      "original_text": "To filter messages in Watson Assistant, you can use the following methods:\n1. Search user statements: Type a word in the search bar. This searches the users' inputs, but not your assistant's replies.\n2. Intents: Select the drop-down menu and type an intent in the input field, or choose from the populated list. You can select more than one intent, which filters the results using any of the selected intents, including Irrelevant.\n3. Entities: Select the drop-down menu and type an entity name in the input field, or choose from the populated list. You can select more than one entity, which filters the results by any of the selected entities. If you filter by intent and entity, your results will include the messages that have both values. You can also filter for results with No entities found.\nAdditionally, messages might take some time to update, and it is recommended to wait at least 30 minutes after a user's interaction with your assistant before attempting to filter for that content."
