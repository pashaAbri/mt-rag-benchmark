It introduced new commands image-obsolete and image-deprecate for image lifecycle management. It also added support for image lifecycle management in image-create, image-update, and images commands and it fixed an issue with using the SSH key generated from UI in CLI.\n|user|: Tell me more about the new commands\n|assistant|: The new commands introduced in version 6.15.0 of the IBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) command line interface (CLI) are image-obsolete and image-deprecate. These commands support image lifecycle management, allowing users to manage the lifecycle of their custom images more effectively. The image-obsolete command can be used to mark an image as obsolete, indicating that it is no longer available to be used to provision an instance. The image-deprecate command can be used to mark an image as deprecated, discouraging its use before it becomes obsolete.\n|user|: How do I use them?\n|assistant|: To use the new `image-obsolete` and `image-deprecate` commands, you need to specify the name or ID of the custom image with the `IMAGE` variable. Here are some examples: - To mark an image as deprecated, use the following command:  ```  ibmcloud is image-deprecate IMAGE  ``` - To mark an image as obsolete, use the following command:  ```  ibmcloud is image-obsolete IMAGE  ``` These commands allow you to make an immediate status change. Alternatively, you can schedule these status changes for a future date and time by using the `ibmcloud is image-update` command with the `--deprecate-at` or `--obsolete-at` options.
