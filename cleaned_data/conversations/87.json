The tasks a bot is programmed to do are fairly simple, but the bot can do these tasks repeatedly at a much faster rate than a human can.\n\nBots don't access the internet using a traditional web browser or a mouse to interact with visual content. Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities.\n\nBots can do almost any repetitive, non-creative task that can be automated, including filling out forms, reading and downloading content, and even hold basic conversations with humans as chatbots.",

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action. Enter (cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed) into the Expression preview section as a singular rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations \n\n\n\n* If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP):\n\n\n\n* Ensure that anything under /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/ is allowed.",

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day.

Overview of the process to build a machine learning model\n\n\n\n1. Based on a set of domain-specific source documents, the team creates a type system that defines entity types and relation types for the information of interest to the application that will use the model.\n2. A group of two or more human annotators annotates a small set of source documents to label words that represent entity types, to identify relation types where the text identifies relationships between entity mentions, and to define coreferences, which identify different mentions that refer to the same thing, that is, the same entity. Any inconsistencies in annotation are resolved, and one set of optimally annotated documents is built, which forms the ground truth.\n3. Knowledge Studio uses the ground truth to train a model.\n4. The trained model is used to find entities, relations, and coreferences in new, never-seen-before documents.\n\n\n\nSee [Creating a machine learning model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-ml_annotator) for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n Build a rule-based model \n\nKnowledge Studio provides a rules editor that simplifies the process of finding and capturing common patterns in your documents as rules. You can then create a model that recognizes the rule patterns, and deploy it for use in other services.\n\nSee [Creating a rule-based model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-knowledge-studio-data?topic=watson-knowledge-studio-data-rule-annotator) for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Analyze text with advanced rules \n\nThe advanced rules feature is Beta.

Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action.

In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:",

Select Configure Bot Management.  Enable auto-updates to the machine learning model.  Enabling auto-updates for the machine learning model upgrades you to the latest version immediately. You can toggle the button off within 24 hours to revert to the previous version. To make changes after 24 hours, contact support.  Indeed it is very important to update the machine because not updating to the latest version, you will be using a machine learning model that is no longer maintained or monitored by the engineering team. As internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, the scoring accuracy of older versions can degrade.\n|user|: Can I create a machine learning model and how should I do that?\n|assistant|: I can give you information about how create a machine learning model in Knowledge Studio. It involves training the machine learning model and evaluating how well the model performed when annotating test data and blind data.    By exploring the performance metrics, you can identify ways to improve the model's accuracy.  Restriction: Only three machine learning models can be trained at a time per Knowledge Studio instance. If your instance contains multiple workspaces and the number of machine learning models that are being trained in other workspaces totals 3 already, then your request to train the machine learning model in your workspace will be queued until the other training processes are done.  It is important to note that . Only documents that became ground truth through approval or adjudication can be used to train the machine learning model. Always have in mind  to create a machine learning model that trains a model you can use to identify entities, coreferences, and relationships of interest in new documents.Knowledge Studio provides a rules editor that simplifies the process of finding and capturing common patterns in your documents as rules. You can then create a model that recognizes the rule patterns, and deploy it for use in other services.\n|user|: Speaking about bots again, can they get private information from the user"

CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n|user|: How does CIS manage bots?\n|assistant|: Cloudflare Bot Management, which is part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services (CIS), manages bots by collecting data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules. The detection mechanisms used by CIS produce their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score.\n|user|: How can I update machine leaning models?\n|assistant|: You  can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.To enable auto-updates:Log in to the CIS and select your account and domain Go toSecurity > Bots.    Select Configure Bot Management.  Enable auto-updates to the machine learning model.  Enabling auto-updates for the machine learning model upgrades you to the latest version immediately. You can toggle the button off within 24 hours to revert to the previous version. To make changes after 24 hours, contact support.  Indeed it is very important to update the machine because not updating to the latest version, you will be using a machine learning model that is no longer maintained or monitored by the engineering team. As internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, the scoring accuracy of older versions can degrade.\n|user|: Can I create a machine learning model and how should I do that?\n|assistant|: I can give you information about how create a machine learning model in Knowledge Studio. It involves training the machine learning model and evaluating how well the model performed when annotating test data and blind data.    By exploring the performance metrics, you can identify ways to improve the model's accuracy.  Restriction: Only three machine learning models can be trained at a time per Knowledge Studio instance. If your instance contains multiple workspaces and the number of machine learning models that are being trained in other workspaces totals 3 already, then your request to train the machine learning model in your workspace will be queued until the other training processes are done.  It is important to note that . Only documents that became ground truth through approval or adjudication can be used to train the machine learning model. Always have in mind  to create a machine learning model that trains a model you can use to identify entities, coreferences, and relationships of interest in new documents.Knowledge Studio provides a rules editor that simplifies the process of finding and capturing common patterns in your documents as rules. You can then create a model that recognizes the rule patterns, and deploy it for use in other services.\n|user|: Speaking about bots again, can they get private information from the user\n|assistant|: Yes, some malicious bots are designed to steal private information from users. They can do this by breaking into user accounts, reading and downloading sensitive content, or intercepting personal data entered into online forms. This is why bot management is important, as it helps to identify and mitigate the actions of such bad bots.\n|user|: By the way, what is a secret?"

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.",

          "text": "\nHow bot management works \n\nTo identify bots, bot managers might use JavaScript challenges (which determine whether a traditional web browser is being used) or CAPTCHA challenges. They can also determine which users are humans and which are bots by behavioral analysis; by comparing a user's behavior to the standard behavior of users in the past.\n\nWhen a bot is identified as bad, it can be redirected to a different page or blocked from accessing a web resource altogether.\n\nGood bots can be added to an allowlist. A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file. Good bots will read the robots.txt file and avoid that webpage; some bad bots will crawl the webpage. By tracking the IP address of the bots that access the honeypot, bad bots can be identified and blocked.\n\n\n\n\n\n Kinds of bot attacks bot management mitigates \n\nA bot management solution can help stop a variety of attacks, including the following:\n\n\n\n* DDoS attacks\n* DoS attacks\n* Credential stuffing\n* Credit card stuffing\n* Brute force password cracking\n* Spam content\n* Data scraping and web scraping\n* Email address harvesting\n* Ad fraud\n* Click fraud\n\n\n\nThese bot activities are not always considered \"malicious,\" but a bot manager should still be able to mitigate them:\n\n\n\n* Inventory hoarding\n* Automated posting on social forums or platforms\n* Shopping cart stuffing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How does CIS manage bots? \n\nCIS collects data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules.\n\nCloudflare Bot Management uses the following detection mechanisms, each producing their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score:",

                      "model_text": "|user|: Can you summarize the differences between good bots and bad bots?\n|assistant|: Bots are software programs that typically use a \"headless browser\" to make HTTP requests and other activities and like any tool they can be used for good and also they can be used for malicious behavior. A bot that performs a helpful service can be considered \"good.\" For example, customer service chatbots, search engine crawlers, and performance monitoring bots are generally good bots. Good bots look for and abide by the rules outlined in a website's robots.txt fileand read them and avoid that webpage. They can also can be added to an allowlist. In the other hand, Bad bots range from malicious to simply annoying; for instance, breaking into user accounts to steal data or buying concert tickets online to assist scalpers.Furthermore,anyone programming a bot is expected to follow an honor system and make sure that their bot checks a website's robots.txt file before accessing the website. Malicious bots don't follow this system, which generates the need for bot management.   \n|user|: What are the features in the CIS bot?\n|assistant|: I do not have much information about  that but  IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services (CIS) bot features include JavaScript detections. A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique. Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. This detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n|user|: How does CIS manage bots?\n|assistant|: Cloudflare Bot Management, which is part of IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services (CIS), manages bots by collecting data from requests flowing through its network every day. With this data, powered by Cloudflare's machine learning and behavior analysis, CIS can identify likely bot activity and can provide you with information on how to allow or disallow specific bot traffic using Firewall Rules. The detection mechanisms used by CIS produce their own scores, which are then combined to form a single score.\n|user|: How can I update machine leaning models?\n|assistant|: You  can enable auto-updates to their machine learning models for the newest bot detection models as they are released.To enable auto-updates:Log in to the CIS and select your account and domain Go toSecurity > Bots.    Select Configure Bot Management.  Enable auto-updates to the machine learning model.  Enabling auto-updates for the machine learning model upgrades you to the latest version immediately. You can toggle the button off within 24 hours to revert to the previous version. To make changes after 24 hours, contact support.  Indeed it is very important to update the machine because not updating to the latest version, you will be using a machine learning model that is no longer maintained or monitored by the engineering team. As internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, the scoring accuracy of older versions can degrade.\n|user|: Can I create a machine learning model and how should I do that?\n|assistant|: I can give you information about how create a machine learning model in Knowledge Studio. It involves training the machine learning model and evaluating how well the model performed when annotating test data and blind data.    By exploring the performance metrics, you can identify ways to improve the model's accuracy.  Restriction: Only three machine learning models can be trained at a time per Knowledge Studio instance. If your instance contains multiple workspaces and the number of machine learning models that are being trained in other workspaces totals 3 already, then your request to train the machine learning model in your workspace will be queued until the other training processes are done.  It is important to note that . Only documents that became ground truth through approval or adjudication can be used to train the machine learning model. Always have in mind  to create a machine learning model that trains a model you can use to identify entities, coreferences, and relationships of interest in new documents.Knowledge Studio provides a rules editor that simplifies the process of finding and capturing common patterns in your documents as rules. You can then create a model that recognizes the rule patterns, and deploy it for use in other services.\n|user|: Speaking about bots again, can they get private information from the user\n|assistant|: Yes, some malicious bots are designed to steal private information from users. They can do this by breaking into user accounts, reading and downloading sensitive content, or intercepting personal data entered into online forms. This is why bot management is important, as it helps to identify and mitigate the actions of such bad bots.\n|user|: By the way, what is a secret?\n|assistant|: A secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.  When  you use secrets, you can authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.   Make sure they  are securely protected through their entire lifecycle.                  \n|user|: How can I protect my privacy?"
