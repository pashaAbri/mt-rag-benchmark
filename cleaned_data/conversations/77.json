The song conveys the message that despite Mars' best efforts to show his love for a woman, she does not reciprocate his feelings. The title \"Grenade\" is a metaphor for how Mars feels about his love for this woman, implying that he would be willing to sacrifice everything, even his own life, for her. This message is further emphasized in the music video, where Mars goes to great lengths to express his love, including dragging a piano through Los Angeles and attempting suicide when he finds out she is with someone else."

'' Mars , sarcastically , replied to rumors related to the use of special effects : `` A lot of people think this is a camera trick , but that is a heavy piano . Luckily , I 've been doing about , you know , 800 to 967 push - ups every day , so it 's not a big deal , I can handle it . '' Regardless , this achievement , Mars was cautious : `` The actions in this video serve as a metaphor , and should not be taken literally .
