Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The atmospheric entry probe carried by Galileo was developed by NASA Ames Research Center. The probe entered the Jovian atmosphere on Dec. 7, 1995, measuring the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere until it was crushed, as expected, by extreme pressure. The Galileo orbiter lasted until September 2003, when JPL ordered it to plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere to ensure that it would not crash into, and contaminate, any of Jupiter's moons. Among other things, Galileo found a water ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet, and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.JPL branches outThe downturn in planetary exploration funding during the 1970s had one welcome consequence: JPL began to seek other kinds of spaceflight tasks. This led the Lab into astronomy and Earth science.One of JPL's technology development efforts in the mid-1970s had been research on improving charge-coupled detectors (CCDs) for use in space. This work was intended for the Galileo camera system, but also resulted in the Laboratory being awarded the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera in 1978. Intended to be the observatory's primary imaging instrument, WFPC operated flawlessly when the telescope was finally launched in 1990.WFPC also helped pinpoint a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's primary mirror. It had been polished to just slightly the wrong shape. The error made Hubble a hugely expensive laughing stock shortly after launch, but JPL scientists realized they could rescue the mission by installing corrective optics in an updated camera. JPL developed the camera, WFPC2, which was installed on Hubble by astronauts in 1993, and operated until removed during a servicing mission in 2009.",

Mission designers used the Sun\u2019s gravity and a pair of main engine burns in September 2012 to guide Juno back toward Earth \u2013 an essential detour.\u00a0\u00a0Juno returned home 26 months after it left. But it didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0\u00a0It dashed toward Earth, pulled in by gravity, then sped away with greater energy than before. In this maneuver, called a gravity assist, Juno borrowed some momentum from Earth \u2013 which itself is hurtling through space around the Sun at 18 miles per second (29 kilometers per second). This slingshot effect boosted Juno\u2019s velocity by 16,330 mph (about 7.3 kilometers per second), giving the spacecraft sufficient energy to climb away from the inner solar system and make it out to Jupiter.",

That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno\u2019s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter\u2019s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere.\u00a0Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet. And Juno\u2019s work continues building on the discoveries of previous missions that visited Jupiter \u2013 Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 in the 1970s, then the Galileo orbiter and its atmospheric probe, as well as those spacecraft who made key observations while en route to other targets (Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons).\u00a0In turn, Juno is also preparing the way for future visitors, such as ESA\u2019s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031. Next to go, NASA\u2019s Europa Clipper is scheduled to launch in October 2024, and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030.",

Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that likely governed our solar system as it formed. Our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also help us understand planetary systems being discovered around other stars.\u00a0\u00a0Theories about solar-system formation all begin with the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust, or nebula, the bulk of which went into forming the infant Sun. Like the Sun, Jupiter is mostly hydrogen and helium, so it must have formed early, capturing most of the material left over after our star came to be. How this happened, however, is unclear.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike Earth, Jupiter's giant mass allowed it to hold onto its original composition; like a time capsule, it provides us with a way to trace our solar system's history. Deciphering the origin and evolution of Jupiter will help us understand the formation of the rest of the solar system, including how Earth came to be, and how it became a haven for life.\u00a0Juno completed its primary mission by mid-2021, offering revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field.

One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter.",

As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025.

Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The atmospheric entry probe carried by Galileo was developed by NASA Ames Research Center. The probe entered the Jovian atmosphere on Dec. 7, 1995, measuring the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere until it was crushed, as expected, by extreme pressure. The Galileo orbiter lasted until September 2003, when JPL ordered it to plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere to ensure that it would not crash into, and contaminate, any of Jupiter's moons. Among other things, Galileo found a water ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet, and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.JPL branches outThe downturn in planetary exploration funding during the 1970s had one welcome consequence: JPL began to seek other kinds of spaceflight tasks. This led the Lab into astronomy and Earth science.One of JPL's technology development efforts in the mid-1970s had been research on improving charge-coupled detectors (CCDs) for use in space. This work was intended for the Galileo camera system, but also resulted in the Laboratory being awarded the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera in 1978. Intended to be the observatory's primary imaging instrument, WFPC operated flawlessly when the telescope was finally launched in 1990.WFPC also helped pinpoint a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's primary mirror. It had been polished to just slightly the wrong shape. The error made Hubble a hugely expensive laughing stock shortly after launch, but JPL scientists realized they could rescue the mission by installing corrective optics in an updated camera. JPL developed the camera, WFPC2, which was installed on Hubble by astronauts in 1993, and operated until removed during a servicing mission in 2009.",

It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provides the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. And its flight past Venus in 1990 yields fascinating infrared images of the planet's clouds. Two years later, Galileo encounters a second asteroid, Ida, and discovers a miniature moonlet orbiting the rocky object, later given the name Dactyl.\n\u203a visit website for more info\n\nOCTOBER 6, 1990First Spacecraft in a Polar Orbit Around the SunUlysses\n\nUlysses is the first mission to survey the space environment above and below the poles of our Sun. A collaboration between NASA and the European Space Agency, Having used Jupiter\u2019s gravity to reach its unique high inclination orbit, Ulysses studies the previously unexplored regions of the Sun's poles. Ulysses eventually completes three full orbits around the Sun and reveals for the first time the 3D character of galactic cosmic radiation, monitors solar wind variation from the poles between solar maximum and minimum, and discovers interstellar dust in the solar system.\n\u203a visit website for more info\n\nAUGUST 25, 1989First Neptune FlybyVoyager 2\n\nTwelve years after leaving Earth, Voyager 2 makes its closest approach to any planet since starting its journey, flying about 3,000 miles (4,950 kilometers) above the north pole of the planet Neptune. Voyager discovers that Neptune \u2013 the eighth and outermost planet from the Sun \u2013 has the strongest winds of any planet encountered, even though it receives the least solar energy. The spacecraft's flyby of Neptune sets it on a course below the elliptic plane that will eventually take it beyond the edge of the solar system.\n\u203a visit website for more info\n\nJANUARY 24, 1986First Uranus MissionVoyager 2\n\nAfter flying by the planets Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 makes history as it executes the first-ever encounter of Uranus, the seventh planet from the Sun.

The orbiter will be the sixth spacecraft to explore the Jovian magnetosphere, but the first to be placed into orbit around the giant planet. Scientific objectives addressed by the orbiter are to: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n\nThe structure of the orbiter is divided into two sections. The main body of the spacecraft, comprised of the electronics bays, propellant system, RTG and science booms, and high-gain antenna, rotates at rates of 3.25 or 10.5 rpm. The despun section, aft of the main body, uses an electric motor to drive it counter to the rotation of the main section. This dual spin attitude control system accommodates instruments which require stable, accurate pointing (the imaging instruments) and those which benefit from repetitive, broad-angular coverage (the various particles and fields instruments). The length of the spacecraft is 9 m and, with the high-gain antenna (HGA) deployed, is 4.6 m in diameter.\n\nPower is provided to the spacecraft through the use of two radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs), each of which is located at the end of a short boom. The magnetometer sensors and plasma wave antenna are located on yet another boom, 10.9 m in length.",

      "original_text": "The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet and its moons. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence suggesting the existence of a subsurface ocean on Europa, one of Jupiter's moons. This discovery has led to further interest in the potential for life beyond Earth. Additionally, Galileo studied Jupiter's atmosphere, magnetosphere, and rings, as well as its moons, including Io, Ganymede, and Callisto. It provided valuable information about their composition, geology, and interactions with Jupiter. However, it is worth noting that the Galileo mission ended when the spacecraft was deliberately crashed into Jupiter in order to avoid any potential contamination of the planet's moons with microscopic life from Earth."

That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .",

This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?"

As with solar eclipses on the Earth, within the dark circle racing across Jupiter's cloud tops one would witness a full solar eclipse as Io passes in front of the Sun. Such events occur frequently on Jupiter because it is a large planet with many moons. In addition, unlike most other planets in our solar system, Jupiter's axis is not highly tilted relative to its orbit, so the Sun never strays far from Jupiter's equatorial plane (+/- 3 degrees).",

During its close passes, Juno observed large cyclones at both of Jupiter's poles, each rotating in the opposite direction of the other. These cyclones are comparable in size to the Earth and are surrounded by many smaller cyclones. This discovery was announced in May 2018, based on data collected by Juno during its first eight flybys of Jupiter.\nOn the other hand, the Galileo spacecraft did not have the capability to directly observe Jupiter's cyclones, as it operated at much higher altitudes and did not have the same level of imaging technology as Juno. However, Galileo did provide valuable information about Jupiter's atmosphere and weather patterns, including the discovery of lightning storms and the measurement of wind speeds."

      "text": "Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.",

One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers).

The scientific term for all these storms is tropical cyclone. Only tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean are called \"hurricanes.\"\nWhatever they are called, tropical cyclones all form the same way.\n\nTropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface. Because this air moves up and away from the surface, there is less air left near the surface. Another way to say the same thing is that the warm air rises, causing an area of lower air pressure below.\n\nA cumulonimbus cloud. A tropical cyclone has so many of these, they form huge, circular bands.\n\nAir from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes in to the low pressure area. Then that \"new\" air becomes warm and moist and rises, too. As the warm air continues to rise, the surrounding air swirls in to take its place. As the warmed, moist air rises and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fed by the ocean's heat and water evaporating from the surface. \nStorms that form north of the equator spin counterclockwise. Storms south of the equator spin clockwise. This difference is because of Earth's rotation on its axis.\nAs the storm system rotates faster and faster, an eye forms in the center.

They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear. However, the specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface."

It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes.

They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane.

          "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nThe self-destruct maneuver would have satisfied NASA\u2019s planetary protection requirements, avoiding any chance Juno could crash into the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, or Callisto \u2013 ocean worlds, with Europa in particular considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth \u2013 and contaminate them with microscopic life from Earth.\u00a0\u00a0The Cassini mission, orbiting Saturn from 2004 to 2017, prompted similar concerns \u2013 protecting the integrity of Saturn\u2019s moons Enceladus and Titan, also believed to contain possibly habitable environments. As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno\u2019s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter\u2019s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere.\u00a0Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet. And Juno\u2019s work continues building on the discoveries of previous missions that visited Jupiter \u2013 Pioneer 10 and 11, and Voyager 1 and 2 in the 1970s, then the Galileo orbiter and its atmospheric probe, as well as those spacecraft who made key observations while en route to other targets (Ulysses, Cassini, and New Horizons).\u00a0In turn, Juno is also preparing the way for future visitors, such as ESA\u2019s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031. Next to go, NASA\u2019s Europa Clipper is scheduled to launch in October 2024, and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030.",

But how far? One of the most fundamental questions about the giant planet, scientists have debated that for decades. By measuring Jupiter\u2019s gravity field, Juno discovered that the belts and zones \u2013 which are alternating east- and west-flowing jet streams \u2013 extend about 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops.\u00a0\u00a0Scientists long thought Jupiter had a small, solid core surrounded by all its hydrogen and helium. Juno data suggests the core is much larger than expected, yet partially dissolved, with no clear separation from the hydrogen swirling around it, leading researchers to describe the core as dilute, or \u201cfuzzy.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Under extreme pressure, gases can turn into their liquid form. Inside Jupiter the atmospheric pressure is so great, it compresses hydrogen gas not merely into liquid, but a fluid known as liquid metallic hydrogen. This exaggerated pressure makes the liquid hydrogen act like a metal conducting electricity, and scientists believe it\u2019s the source of Jupiter\u2019s uniquely intense magnetic field. Years of Juno measurements of Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field point to that possibility, at a depth much shallower than expected.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before Juno arrived, the largest planet in our solar system still had vast areas unexplored, unknown, even unseen.

Juno was the first to fly over the north and south poles, a unique vantage point that accounts for many of the mission\u2019s surprises.\u00a0\u00a0Scientists discovered that the massive auroras undulating at Jupiter\u2019s poles seem to form by different processes than the northern lights and southern lights on Earth. Investigators also discovered that lightning storms, which on Earth are more common near the equator, are a polar phenomenon on Jupiter, where they drop softball-sized hailstones of ammonia and water.\u00a0A technical concern arose early in the mission, however \u2013 it changed Juno\u2019s timeline, and altered what it would accomplish during its time in orbit.\u00a0\u00a0Originally, the flight plan had Juno looping around Jupiter for a couple of 53-day orbits, then shrinking those orbits to 14 days for the remainder of the mission \u2013 spending about 15 months circling and studying the planet. But a problem in the main engine, with some valves not working as expected, troubled the Juno team; a misfire could prove disastrous. They decided to maintain the status quo of the longer orbits.\u00a0Each flyby of Jupiter would give Juno\u2019s instruments the same two-hour window to collect data, but they would come every seven weeks, instead of every two.\u00a0The new plan meant a much longer schedule to complete Juno\u2019s science goals. Then again, the wider orbits would allow for \u201cbonus science\u201d that wasn\u2019t part of the original mission design.\u00a0\u00a0The spacecraft could further explore the far reaches of space dominated by Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. And after it completed its initial goals, and NASA extended the mission, the Juno team realized that the long orbits would evolve to eventually put the planet\u2019s Galilean moons within reach.\u00a0On June 7, 2021, during orbit 34, Juno flew within 652 miles of Ganymede, Jupiter\u2019s largest moon (in fact, the largest moon in the solar system). It was the closest such encounter since the Galileo spacecraft flew by Ganymede in May 2000.",

Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.\n|user|: Could you tell me about the most important discoveries that Juno did in its way to Jupiter and also what it found in that huge planet?\n|assistant|:  NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno\u2019s transition into a full Jovian system explorer.Now in its extended mission, Juno will continue its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft\u2019s end of life. This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .\n|user|: By the way, how are the cyclones on earth formed?\n|assistant|: Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?\n|assistant|: No, the cyclones on Jupiter cannot affect the Earth or cause damage to cities and people. This is because Jupiter is very far away from Earth, with an average distance of about 5.3 astronomical units (AU) or 778 million kilometers.Only the belts and zones of Jupiter extend about 1,900 mile(3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Additionally, Jupiter does not have a solid surface for the storms to make landfall on, unlike Earth. The cyclones on Jupiter are also different from those on Earth in terms of their formation and behavior, as they are driven by different atmospheric conditions and dynamic.They travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on earth.\n|user|:  For now does Nasa scientists have  plans to send new spacecrafts to other planets beside Jupiter?"

As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach.

Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.\n|user|: Could you tell me about the most important discoveries that Juno did in its way to Jupiter and also what it found in that huge planet?\n|assistant|:  NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno\u2019s transition into a full Jovian system explorer.Now in its extended mission, Juno will continue its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft\u2019s end of life. This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .\n|user|: By the way, how are the cyclones on earth formed?\n|assistant|: Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?\n|assistant|: No, the cyclones on Jupiter cannot affect the Earth or cause damage to cities and people. This is because Jupiter is very far away from Earth, with an average distance of about 5.3 astronomical units (AU) or 778 million kilometers.Only the belts and zones of Jupiter extend about 1,900 mile(3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Additionally, Jupiter does not have a solid surface for the storms to make landfall on, unlike Earth. The cyclones on Jupiter are also different from those on Earth in terms of their formation and behavior, as they are driven by different atmospheric conditions and dynamic.They travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on earth.\n|user|:  For now does Nasa scientists have  plans to send new spacecrafts to other planets beside Jupiter?"

But  the two spacecrafts most famous to reach Jupiter were Juno and Galileo. Juno began its circuitous five-year journey to Jupiter on August 5  of 2011 and it was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast . Juno mission completed its 50th close pass by Jupiter since its arrived at the big planet in 2016.  It is important to note that Juno is preparing the way for future visitors such as ESA\u2019s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.  Galileo mission to Jupiter had been authorized in October 1977 for a 1982 space shuttle launch, but there were some delays to the shuttle program, confusion over the development of an appropriate upper stage to send the probe on its way out of Earth orbit, and finally the loss of space shuttle Challenger and its crew in 1986, postponed Galileo's launch until 1989. Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.\n|user|: Could you tell me about the most important discoveries that Juno did in its way to Jupiter and also what it found in that huge planet?\n|assistant|:  NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno\u2019s transition into a full Jovian system explorer.Now in its extended mission, Juno will continue its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft\u2019s end of life. This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .\n|user|: By the way, how are the cyclones on earth formed?\n|assistant|: Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?\n|assistant|: No, the cyclones on Jupiter cannot affect the Earth or cause damage to cities and people. This is because Jupiter is very far away from Earth, with an average distance of about 5.3 astronomical units (AU) or 778 million kilometers.Only the belts and zones of Jupiter extend about 1,900 mile(3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Additionally, Jupiter does not have a solid surface for the storms to make landfall on, unlike Earth. The cyclones on Jupiter are also different from those on Earth in terms of their formation and behavior, as they are driven by different atmospheric conditions and dynamic.They travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on earth.\n|user|:  For now does Nasa scientists have  plans to send new spacecrafts to other planets beside Jupiter?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA has plans to send new spacecraft to other planets besides Jupiter.For instance, the Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030, with the goal of searching for life-sustaining conditions exising below the surface of Jupiter\u2019s fourth largest moon, Europ. An interesting fact is that Europa Clipper spacecraft will carry a richly layered dispatch that includes more than 2.6 million names submitted by the public.  Additionally, the Dragonfly mission will send a rotorcraft lander to explore a variety of locations on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan in 2028.\n|user|: Those mission to space searching for new discoveries on planets like Jupiter, Saturn must cost a lot money .

As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025.

It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .\n|user|: By the way, how are the cyclones on earth formed?\n|assistant|: Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?\n|assistant|: No, the cyclones on Jupiter cannot affect the Earth or cause damage to cities and people. This is because Jupiter is very far away from Earth, with an average distance of about 5.3 astronomical units (AU) or 778 million kilometers.Only the belts and zones of Jupiter extend about 1,900 mile(3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Additionally, Jupiter does not have a solid surface for the storms to make landfall on, unlike Earth. The cyclones on Jupiter are also different from those on Earth in terms of their formation and behavior, as they are driven by different atmospheric conditions and dynamic.They travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on earth.\n|user|:  For now does Nasa scientists have  plans to send new spacecrafts to other planets beside Jupiter?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA has plans to send new spacecraft to other planets besides Jupiter.For instance, the Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030, with the goal of searching for life-sustaining conditions exising below the surface of Jupiter\u2019s fourth largest moon, Europ. An interesting fact is that Europa Clipper spacecraft will carry a richly layered dispatch that includes more than 2.6 million names submitted by the public.  Additionally, the Dragonfly mission will send a rotorcraft lander to explore a variety of locations on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan in 2028.\n|user|: Those mission to space searching for new discoveries on planets like Jupiter, Saturn must cost a lot money .

                    "model_text": "|user|: Name two spacecraft that were sent to explore Jupiter.\n|assistant|: Previous missions were sent to Jupiter like Pioneer 10 and 11 and also Voyager 1 and 2 in the 1970s. But  the two spacecrafts most famous to reach Jupiter were Juno and Galileo. Juno began its circuitous five-year journey to Jupiter on August 5  of 2011 and it was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast . Juno mission completed its 50th close pass by Jupiter since its arrived at the big planet in 2016.  It is important to note that Juno is preparing the way for future visitors such as ESA\u2019s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.  Galileo mission to Jupiter had been authorized in October 1977 for a 1982 space shuttle launch, but there were some delays to the shuttle program, confusion over the development of an appropriate upper stage to send the probe on its way out of Earth orbit, and finally the loss of space shuttle Challenger and its crew in 1986, postponed Galileo's launch until 1989. Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.\n|user|: Could you tell me about the most important discoveries that Juno did in its way to Jupiter and also what it found in that huge planet?\n|assistant|:  NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno\u2019s transition into a full Jovian system explorer.Now in its extended mission, Juno will continue its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft\u2019s end of life. This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter.

The costs are typically covered by a combination of government funding, usually from the national space agency, and sometimes private investment.

Similarly, the Europa Clipper mission, which is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030, is estimated to cost around $4 billion USD, and it is being funded by NASA as well. The Dragonfly mission to explore Saturn's moon Titan in 2028 is estimated to cost around $850 million and it is being funded by NASA too."

But  the two spacecrafts most famous to reach Jupiter were Juno and Galileo. Juno began its circuitous five-year journey to Jupiter on August 5  of 2011 and it was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast . Juno mission completed its 50th close pass by Jupiter since its arrived at the big planet in 2016.  It is important to note that Juno is preparing the way for future visitors such as ESA\u2019s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.  Galileo mission to Jupiter had been authorized in October 1977 for a 1982 space shuttle launch, but there were some delays to the shuttle program, confusion over the development of an appropriate upper stage to send the probe on its way out of Earth orbit, and finally the loss of space shuttle Challenger and its crew in 1986, postponed Galileo's launch until 1989. Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.\n|user|: Could you tell me about the most important discoveries that Juno did in its way to Jupiter and also what it found in that huge planet?\n|assistant|:  NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno\u2019s transition into a full Jovian system explorer.Now in its extended mission, Juno will continue its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft\u2019s end of life. This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .\n|user|: By the way, how are the cyclones on earth formed?\n|assistant|: Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?\n|assistant|: No, the cyclones on Jupiter cannot affect the Earth or cause damage to cities and people. This is because Jupiter is very far away from Earth, with an average distance of about 5.3 astronomical units (AU) or 778 million kilometers.Only the belts and zones of Jupiter extend about 1,900 mile(3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Additionally, Jupiter does not have a solid surface for the storms to make landfall on, unlike Earth. The cyclones on Jupiter are also different from those on Earth in terms of their formation and behavior, as they are driven by different atmospheric conditions and dynamic.They travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on earth.\n|user|:  For now does Nasa scientists have  plans to send new spacecrafts to other planets beside Jupiter?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA has plans to send new spacecraft to other planets besides Jupiter.For instance, the Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030, with the goal of searching for life-sustaining conditions exising below the surface of Jupiter\u2019s fourth largest moon, Europ. An interesting fact is that Europa Clipper spacecraft will carry a richly layered dispatch that includes more than 2.6 million names submitted by the public.  Additionally, the Dragonfly mission will send a rotorcraft lander to explore a variety of locations on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan in 2028.\n|user|: Those mission to space searching for new discoveries on planets like Jupiter, Saturn must cost a lot money . How much  are we talking about and who financial them?\n|assistant|: I do not have the financial number for  the costs of those missions and who did  financial them but I can tell you the primary goal of NASA's Discovery program is to conduct a series of frequent, highly focused, cost-effective missions to answer critical questions in solar system science. Formally started in NASA's FY 1994 budget, the Discovery program featured small planetary exploration spacecraft with focused science goals that could be built in 36 months or less, for less than $190 million in development costs and a total mission cost of less than $299 million. The program has expanded since then, but still concentrates on smaller missions that require less resources and shorter development times than the larger \"flagship\" missions. For instance the NSSDCA - Spacecraft cost mission was $220.5 million, which included $43.5 million for the launch vehicle and $60.8 million for mission operations after launch.\n|user|: It seems NASA has invested a lot in its programs . How can all this money help mankind to live better?"

As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno\u2019s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter\u2019s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere.\u00a0Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet.
