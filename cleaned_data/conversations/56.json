This is not a gift. All the CRA has to show is that there was a reasonable expectation that the property would be sold and the money returned to the parent. That's obviously the case here; in your timeline, the evidence is in the two bank accounts after approximately six months. As to whether you'd get away with tax fraud of this nature, that depends on how careful the CRA is willing to investigate. There's another risk, too. Canada's at risk of a market correction on real-estate prices, where prices might drop 20-40%, or worse if you are pessimistic. That's speculation, of course, but such corrections are common-place over the long-term. If you buy a house today with the expectation of improving it and flipping it in six months, you run a very real risk of not recovering your initial investment, let alone the time and materials invested. Heck, you might not be able to sell the house at all. And from the parent's point of view, there's nothing to be done. They can't claim this was a gift, and now claim any sort of obligation whatsoever. The child isn't obligated to sell at a loss, and may not be able to sell in any case.",

If they see a large transfer of money into your bank account within about a year before your purchase, this WILL cause an issue for you. Down payments are not just there to make the principal smaller; they are primarily used as an underwriting data-point to assess your quality as a borrower. If you take the money as loan, it will count against your credit worthiness. If you take the money as a gift, it will raise some other red flags. All of this is done for a reason: if you can't get a down payment, you are a higher credit risk (poor discipline, lack of consistent income), even if you can (currently) pay the monthly cost of a mortgage.  (PS - The cost of home ownership is much higher than the monthly mortgage payment.) Will all this mean you WON'T get a loan? Of course not. You can almost always get SOME loan. But it will likely be at a higher rate than you otherwise would qualify for if you just waited a little bit and saved money for a down payment.  (Another option: cheaper house.) EDIT: The below comments provide examples where gifts were/are NOT a problem. My experience from buying a house just a few years ago (and my several friends who bought house in the same period, some with family gifts and some without) is that it IS an issue. Your best bet is to TALK, IN PERSON with an actual mortgage broker in your area who can go through the options with you, and the downsides to various approaches.",

You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?"

While your rate looks very competitive, it looks like there will be a .5% fee for a refinance on top of other closing costs.   If I have the numbers correct, you are looking to finance about 120K, and the house is worth about 140K.  Given your salary and equity, you should have no problem getting a conventional loan assuming good enough credit.   While the 30 year is tempting, the thing I hate about it is that you will be 78 when the home is paid off.  Are you intending on working that long?  Also you are restarting the clock on your mortgage.  Presumably you have paid on it for a number of years, and now you will start that long journey over. If you were to take the 15 year how much would go to retirement?  You claim that the $320 in savings will go toward retirement if you take the 30 year, but could you save any if you took the 15 year? All in all I would rate your plan a B-.  It is a plan that will allow you to retire with dignity, and is not based on crazy assumptions.  Your success comes in the execution.  Will you actually put the $320 into retirement, or will the needs of the kids come before that?  A strict budget is really a key component with a stay at home spouse. The A+ plan would be to get the 15 year, and put about $650 toward retirement each month.  Its tough to do, but what sacrifices can you make to get there?  Can you move your plan a bit closer to the ideal plan? One thing you have not addressed is how you will handle college for the kids.  While in the process of long term planning, you might want to get on the same page with your wife on what you will offer the kids for help with college.  A viable plan is to pay their room and board, have them work, and for them to pay their own tuition to community college.  They are responsible for their own spending money and transportation.

Rates are pretty tight, if one lender were more that 1/4% lower than another, they'd be inundated with applications. Above a certain credit score, you get the 'best' rate, a search will show you the rates offered in your area.  If you are a first time buyer, there are mortgages that might benefit you. If you are a vet (for non-native English readers, a veteran who served in the US armed forces, not a veterinarian, who is an animal doctor) there are mortgages that offer low-to-no down payment with attractive rates.  Yes, avoid PMI, it's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase. If banks qualify you for different amounts, it shouldn't be a huge difference, a few percent variation. But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36. But I wouldn't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase, that's asking for trouble.",

Anyone who describes a mortgage as \"\"something\"\" obviously has no idea what they are doing and should never sign a mortgage which is a promise to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars. You would be doubly foolish to sign the mortgage because if you are guaranteeing the loan, you own nothing. So, for example, if your friend sold the house, pocketed the money, then left the country you would owe the full amount of the mortgage. Since you are not on the deed there is no way you can prevent this from happening. He does not need your approval to sell the house. So, essentially what your \"\"friend\"\" is doing is asking you to assume all the risk of the mortgage with none of the benefits, since he gets the house, not you. If a \"\"girlfriend\"\" is involved, that just increases the risk you will have a problem. Also, although it is not clear, it appears this is a second house for him. If so, that disqualifies him from any mortgage assistance or relief, so the risk is even higher. Basically, it would foolish in the extreme to co-sign the loan.\"",

That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale.

          "text": "\nThe short answer is, with limited credit, your best bet might be an FHA loan for first time buyers.  They only require 3.5% down (if I recall the number right), and you can qualify for their loan programs with a credit score as low as 580. The problem is that even if you were to add new credit lines (such as signing up for new credit cards, etc.), they still take time to have a positive effect on your credit.  First, your score takes a bit of a hit with each new hard inquiry by a prospective creditor, then your score will dip slightly when a new credit account is first added. While your credit score will improve somewhat within a few months of adding new credit and you begin to show payment history on those accounts, your average age of accounts needs to be two years or older for the best effect, assuming you're making all of the payments on time. A good happy medium is to have between 7 and 10 credit lines on your credit history, and to make sure it's a mix of account types, such as store cards, installment loans, and credit cards, to show that you can handle various types of credit. Be careful not to add TOO much credit, because it affects your debt-to-income ratio, and that will have a negative effect on your ability to obtain mortgage financing. I really suggest that you look at some of the sites which offer free credit scores, because some of them provide great advice and tips on how to achieve what you're trying to do.  They also offer credit score simulators, which can help you understand how your score might change if, for instance, you add new credit cards, pay off existing cards, or take on installment loans.  It's well worth checking out. I hope this helps.  Good luck!",

If you are getting an FHA loan ,if possible put down 20% so that you do not have to pay PMI. That said your PMI costs should be reduced by the size of your down payment since the PMI covers the difference between your equity value (Based on the appraisal at time of purchase) and 20% equity value of the home. So if you buy a home for 425k(assuming 100% appraisal price) 20% equity would be 85k. So if you put 10% down you would be paying PMI until you accrue an addition 42500 in equity. And you will be paying PMI on that for about 12 years(typical on 30 year mortgage) or until you refinance(having home appraised at higher value than purchase price where you would have 20% equity). There are ways to get out of PMI early but few banks are willing to help you through the hoops unless you refinance(and pay more closing costs). 2 - Different banks offer better rates or other benefits for paying points. We paid $300 for a 1.5% reduction in our interest rate (less than 1%) but it was called a point. We were offered a few other points (.25% for 2500 and an one time on demand interest rate adjustment for ~3k) but declined but they may make more sense on a 425k home than our more modest one. You can talk to a banker about this now, get preapproved(which helps with getting offers accepted sometimes), and find out more details about the mortgage they will offer you. This meeting should be free(I would say will but some bank would charge just to prove me wrong) and help answer your questions more authoritatively than anyone here can. 3 - The costs will come out of your down payment. So if you put down 42.5k down your costs will come out of that. So you will probably end up with 30~35k being applied towards your purchase price with the rest going for costs.",

Remember the FHA is only an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan.  The bank won't take the risk of violating their insurance policy and the government refusing to pay them off if you default. Instead, consider doing a creative sale on your property, maybe a rent to own deal or owner financing. As long as you pay the mortgage the bank won't even know you don't live there and you can rent the house out to someone who eventually will buy it after the timeframe expires. Meanwhile you can go and get a new home or condo either thru regular financing or owner financing(search the internet to see how to do this) and you can use owner financing until you complete the sale of the first house. Otherwise just tough it out in the house you are in until the time expires and then sell. You made no mention of the property value but I am assuming if you bought it 3 years ago that you may have a little equity. Pleas note that if you sell at that time though you will likely have to come out of cash because your equity won't cover the realtor fee and closing cost. But if you do the rent to own I suggested earlier you can sell at a slightly higher price making sure you can cover those cost. I realize this answer is a little out the box but I deal with people who don't want properties all day and I have completed transactions like this many times. Good Luck and God Bless!",

Rates are pretty tight, if one lender were more that 1/4% lower than another, they'd be inundated with applications. Above a certain credit score, you get the 'best' rate, a search will show you the rates offered in your area.  If you are a first time buyer, there are mortgages that might benefit you. If you are a vet (for non-native English readers, a veteran who served in the US armed forces, not a veterinarian, who is an animal doctor) there are mortgages that offer low-to-no down payment with attractive rates.  Yes, avoid PMI, it's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase. If banks qualify you for different amounts, it shouldn't be a huge difference, a few percent variation. But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36. But I wouldn't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase, that's asking for trouble.",

What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates. However, in a seller's market, buyers with VA loans may face challenges as some sellers might prefer offers with fewer barriers. Have you looked at conventional financing rather than VA? VA loans are not always a great deal. Conventional tends to be the best, and FHA being better than VA.

Fannie May and Freddie Mac could care less, and FHA and VA backed loans allow for full gifting unless the buyer's credit is below the standard 620, then 3.5% must come from the buyer. Standard bank loans want to know the source of the down payment for ONE REASON ONLY: to know if the buyer is taking ON A NEW DEBT! The only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift.  That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale.

Their agent will be more than happy keep the entire fee if they don't have to split it with your agent.  If you don't have an agent you will be missing somebody who can help you find the property that meets your needs. They can also help explain what the different parts of the contract mean and give you advice regarding making an offer. Do I need to pay for an inspection, or am I likely to save enough   money from skipping it to cover potential problems that they would   have caught? Inspections are optional. Though the amount you are risking is the entire value of the purchase. If the property has a problem in the foundation, or the septic system, or the plumbing or electrical the cost to fix the issue could render the purchase not worth doing. If you discover the problem a year later and you have to repair the house and have to find temporary housing for a few months, you will regret skipping the inspection. What are some of the ways I can cut expenses on closing costs? Is   there any low-hanging fruit? You need to do your homework. When you are ready to purchase a property take good look at the good faith estimate and look at each item.  Ask them what the expense covers. Push back against those that seem optional or excessive. Keep in mind that moving the closing date from the end of a month to the start of the next month only changes the timing those charges, it doesn't really save you money. Rolling the costs into the loan sound easy but you have to think about. It means that you will be paying interest on those charges for the life of the loan. It is good that you are starting to think about all the costs.",

If you don't have an agent, you may miss out on their expertise in finding properties that meet your needs, explaining contract terms, and advising you on making offers. Inspections are optional, but skipping them can put you at risk of overlooking potential issues with the property that could be costly to fix. Closing costs can be negotiated, and you can save money by carefully reviewing the good faith estimate and pushing back against optional or excessive fees. However, rolling closing costs into the loan means you'll pay interest on those charges for the life of the loan. While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls."

Rates are pretty tight, if one lender were more that 1/4% lower than another, they'd be inundated with applications. Above a certain credit score, you get the 'best' rate, a search will show you the rates offered in your area.  If you are a first time buyer, there are mortgages that might benefit you. If you are a vet (for non-native English readers, a veteran who served in the US armed forces, not a veterinarian, who is an animal doctor) there are mortgages that offer low-to-no down payment with attractive rates.  Yes, avoid PMI, it's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase. If banks qualify you for different amounts, it shouldn't be a huge difference, a few percent variation. But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36. But I wouldn't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase, that's asking for trouble.",

What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates. However, in a seller's market, buyers with VA loans may face challenges as some sellers might prefer offers with fewer barriers. Have you looked at conventional financing rather than VA? VA loans are not always a great deal. Conventional tends to be the best, and FHA being better than VA. It is also important to note that veterans can  make themselves more appealing to sellers with non-VA loans.\n|user|: Benefits of FHA loan?\n|assistant|: FHA is an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan. An FHA loan has several benefits. Firstly, it only requires a 3.5% down payment and allows for lower credit scores compared to traditional mortgages. This makes it a viable option for first-time homebuyers or those with limited credit history. Secondly, the PMI costs associated with FHA loans can be reduced by the size of the down payment. However, it's important to note that FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan, which can increase the overall cost of the mortgage.\n|user|: Do I need a real estate agent?\n|assistant|: Whether or not you need a real estate agent depends on your individual needs and circumstances.

Fannie May and Freddie Mac could care less, and FHA and VA backed loans allow for full gifting unless the buyer's credit is below the standard 620, then 3.5% must come from the buyer. Standard bank loans want to know the source of the down payment for ONE REASON ONLY: to know if the buyer is taking ON A NEW DEBT! The only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift.  That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale.

Once you get below 20% loan to value, you can petition the mortgage company to remove the PMI (with conventional loans; VA and FHA have lifetime PMI). If it was me, I'd do one of two things.  Both involve paying off the student loan now.  The savings from the student loan payment will assist you in helping you meet one of the two goals below.  Also both involve getting a 15 year fixed. The first would be to buy the house now, and work like crazy to get rid of the PMI.  My goal would be to get rid of this within 18 months.   The second would be to save up enough cash for the 20% down and then buy the house.  You'd miss out on the house you are looking at, which is kind of heartbreaking.  Who is to say that a better home does not come along at the same price?  My goal would be to have the downpayment in 9 months, and really try to have it in 6 months. Being an old guy that has experience how much of a virtue patience is, I'd recommend the second option.",

          "text": "\n\"Here in the U.S., a realtor can act as a \"\"seller's agent\"\" or a \"\"buyer's agent\"\". I think what you are calling a \"\"broker\"\" in the U.S. we call a \"\"buyer's agent\"\", and this may just be a difference in terminology, from your post it sounds like the concept is the same. I am answering from a U.S. perspective, please let me know if something doesn't make sense in the Israeli context. Here, each typically gets 3% to 3.5% of the sale price (at least in my part of the country). So yes, the buyer's agent has an incentive to get a higher price, even though this is contrary to the interests of the person he is supposed to represent. On the other hand, the buyer's agent has a strong incentive to find a house at a price that you consider acceptable. If the absolute most you are willing to pay is, say, \u20aa1,000,000, and he keeps showing you houses that cost \u20aa1,500,000, he's just wasting his time. (He's wasting your time too, of course, but let's assume he doesn't care about that.) (I don't know what housing prices are in Israel today, just making up numbers.) Suppose he has two houses that he can show you, one in your price range and one not. If he shows you the first you may buy it and we will very quickly get his commission. If he shows you the second, you probably won't buy it and he'll get zero. If he keeps showing you houses above your price range, he's doing a bunch of work for which he will never be paid. The worst case from your point of view is if you're thinking that you're expecting and prepared to pay, say, \u20aa1,000,000 to \u20aa1,300,000, and you tell the broker that, his incentive is to concentrate on the upper end, maybe even push it a little.",

      "text": "The decision between buying and renting a home is a complex one that depends mostly on what makes economic sense. Pros of buying: - Building equity: When you buy a home, some of your monthly payment goes towards building equity in the property. - Tax benefits: Mortgage interest and property taxes are tax-deductible. - Freedom to customize: When you own a home, you have the freedom to customize it to your liking. - Stability: Owning a home can provide a sense of stability and security. Cons of buying: - Upfront costs: Buying a home typically requires a significant down payment and closing costs. - Maintenance and repairs: Homeowners are responsible for maintenance and repairs. A lot depends on how much of that you do yourself - Lack of mobility: buying only makes sense if you stay in the house for 5 years or more. Pros of renting: Rent. If you have no idea whether you will still be in the same part of the country five years from now - Lower upfront costs: Renting typically requires less upfront costs compared to buying. - No responsibility for maintenance and repairs. Cons of renting: - No equity building. - Rent increases: Rents can increase over time. - Limited customization: Renters typically have limited ability to customize their living space. Consider your individual needs, circumstances, and financial situation when making the decision between buying and renting.",

          "text": "\nApplying for a mortgage is a bit of paperwork, but not too bad of an experience. Rates are pretty tight, if one lender were more that 1/4% lower than another, they'd be inundated with applications. Above a certain credit score, you get the 'best' rate, a search will show you the rates offered in your area.  If you are a first time buyer, there are mortgages that might benefit you. If you are a vet (for non-native English readers, a veteran who served in the US armed forces, not a veterinarian, who is an animal doctor) there are mortgages that offer low-to-no down payment with attractive rates.  Yes, avoid PMI, it's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase. If banks qualify you for different amounts, it shouldn't be a huge difference, a few percent variation. But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36. But I wouldn't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase, that's asking for trouble.",

What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates. However, in a seller's market, buyers with VA loans may face challenges as some sellers might prefer offers with fewer barriers. Have you looked at conventional financing rather than VA? VA loans are not always a great deal. Conventional tends to be the best, and FHA being better than VA. It is also important to note that veterans can  make themselves more appealing to sellers with non-VA loans.\n|user|: Benefits of FHA loan?\n|assistant|: FHA is an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan. An FHA loan has several benefits. Firstly, it only requires a 3.5% down payment and allows for lower credit scores compared to traditional mortgages. This makes it a viable option for first-time homebuyers or those with limited credit history. Secondly, the PMI costs associated with FHA loans can be reduced by the size of the down payment. However, it's important to note that FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan, which can increase the overall cost of the mortgage.\n|user|: Do I need a real estate agent?\n|assistant|: Whether or not you need a real estate agent depends on your individual needs and circumstances. In the United States, the seller typically pays the real estate agent fee. If you don't have an agent, you may miss out on their expertise in explaining contract terms, advising you on making offers, the option to do inspections. While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls.\n|user|: How to become a real estate agent and does it pay?\n|assistant|: To become a real estate agent, you would typically need to take a pre-licensing course from a certified provider within your state, pass a licensing exam, and then complete a certain number of hours of post-licensing education. As for whether it pays, real estate agents typically make a commission of 3% to 3.5% of the sale price of a property, which can vary depending on the location and the sale price. However, earnings can be unpredictable and depend on various factors such as the number of transactions and the sale prices of the properties. And they only get paid if the house sells.\n|user|: Buying vs renting a home."

Fannie May and Freddie Mac could care less, and FHA and VA backed loans allow for full gifting unless the buyer's credit is below the standard 620, then 3.5% must come from the buyer. Standard bank loans want to know the source of the down payment for ONE REASON ONLY: to know if the buyer is taking ON A NEW DEBT! The only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift.  That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale. Get it? They just want to know how many hands are in the fire.",

Once you get below 20% loan to value, you can petition the mortgage company to remove the PMI (with conventional loans; VA and FHA have lifetime PMI). If it was me, I'd do one of two things.  Both involve paying off the student loan now.  The savings from the student loan payment will assist you in helping you meet one of the two goals below.  Also both involve getting a 15 year fixed. The first would be to buy the house now, and work like crazy to get rid of the PMI.  My goal would be to get rid of this within 18 months.   The second would be to save up enough cash for the 20% down and then buy the house.  You'd miss out on the house you are looking at, which is kind of heartbreaking.  Who is to say that a better home does not come along at the same price?  My goal would be to have the downpayment in 9 months, and really try to have it in 6 months. Being an old guy that has experience how much of a virtue patience is, I'd recommend the second option.",

          "text": "\n\"Some pros and cons to renting vs buying: Some advantages of buying: When you rent, the money you pay is gone. When you buy, assuming you don't have the cash to buy outright but get a mortgage, some of the payment goes to interest, but you are building equity. Ultimately you pay off the mortgage and you can then live rent-free. When you buy, you can alter your home to your liking. You can paint in the colors you like, put in the carpet or flooring you like, heck, tear down walls and alter the floor plan (subject to building codes and safety consideration, of course). If you rent, you are usually sharply limited in what alterations you can make. In the U.S., mortgage interest is tax deductible. Rent is not. Property taxes are deductible from your federal income tax. So if you have, say, $1000 mortgage vs $1000 rent, the mortgage is actually cheaper. Advantages of renting: There are a lot of transaction costs involved in buying a house. You have to pay a realtor's commission, various legal fees, usually \"\"loan origination fees\"\" to the bank, etc. Plus the way mortgages are designed, your total payment is the same throughout the life of the loan. But for the first payment you owe interest on the total balance of the loan, while the last payment you only owe interest on a small amount. So early payments are mostly interest. This leads to the conventional advice that you should not buy unless you plan to live in the house for some reasonably long period of time, exact amount varying with whose giving the advice, but I think 3 to 5 years is common. One mitigating factor: Bear in mind that if you buy a house, and then after 2 years sell it, and you discover that the sale price minus purchase price minus closing costs ends up a net minus, say, $20,000, it's not entirely fair to say \"\"zounds! I lost $20,000 by buying\"\". If you had not bought this house, presumably you would have been renting. So the fair comparison is, mortgage payments plus losses on the resale compared to likely rental payments for the same period.\"",

          "text": "\nLet me add a few thoughts that have not been mentioned so far in the other answers. Note that for the decision of buying vs. renting a home i.e. for personal use, not for renting out there's a rule of thumb that if the price for buying is more than 20 year's (cold) rents it is considered rather expensive. I don't know how localized this rule of thumb is, but I know it for Germany which is apparently the OP's country, too. There are obviously differences between buying a house/flat for yourself and in order to rent it out. As others have said, maintenance is a major factor for house owners - and here a lot depends on how much of that you do yourself (i.e. do you have the possibility to trade working hours for costs - which is closely related to financial risk exposure, e.g. increasing income by cutting costs as you do maintenance work yourself if you loose your day-time job?). This plays a crucial role for landlords I know (they're all small-scale landlords, and most of them do put in substantial work themselves): I know quite a number of people who rent out flats in the house where they actually live. Some of the houses were built with flats and the owner lives in one of the flats, another rather typical setup is that people built their house in the way that a smaller flat can easily be separated and let once the kids moved out (note also that the legal situation for the landlord is easier in that special case). I also know someone who owns a house several 100 km away from where they live and they say they intentionally ask a rent somewhat below the market price for that (nice) kind of flat so that they have lots of applicants at the same time and tenants don't move out as finding a new tenant is lots of work and costly because of the distance. My personal conclusion from those points is that as an investment (i.e. not for immediate or future personal use) I'd say that the exact circumstances are very important: if you are (stably) based in a region where the buying-to-rental-price ratio is favorable, you have the necessary time and are able to do maintenance work yourself and there is a chance to buy a suitable house closeby then why not.",

This is just based on default values for various other parameters, though, like mortgage interest rate, rent increase rate, etc.  You could try playing around with the numbers.  Also as other answerers said, maintenance costs, closing costs, etc., should be factored in. If renting it out is a possibility even if you move out, it could be a better deal.  One thing to think about renting-wise is, if you move out, where are you likely to move to?  If you move far away, it could be impractical to manage the property as a rental.  You could hire someone else to do that, but that would reduce your income from the rent.  On the other hand, if you stay in LA, it could be feasible to manage the property yourself. Another key factor is, what rent would you be able to charge for this house?  If you can make enough in rent to cover the mortgage payment, you may be in good shape; but due to overpriced real estate markets, sometimes you won't be able to do that, which would mean renting it might not be cost-effective.",

          "text": "\nBuying a house may save you money compared with renting, depending on the area and specifics of the transaction (including the purchase price, interest rates, comparable rent, etc.). In addition, buying a house may provide you with intangibles that fit your lifestyle goals (permanence in a community, ability to renovate, pride of ownership, etc.). These factors have been discussed in other answers here and in other questions. However there is one other way I think potential home buyers should consider the financial impact of home ownership: Buying a house provides you with a natural 'hedge' against possible future changes in your cost of living. Assume the following: If these two items are true, then buying a home allows you to guarantee today that your monthly living expenses will be mostly* fixed, as long as you live in that community. In 2 years, if there is an explosion of new residents in your community and housing costs skyrocket - doesn't affect you, your mortgage payment [or if you paid cash, the lack of mortgage payment] is fixed. In 3 years, if there are 20 new apartment buildings built beside you and housing costs plummet - doesn't affect you, your mortgage payment is fixed. If you know that you want to live in a particular place 20 years from now, then buying a house in that area today may be a way of ensuring that you can afford to live there in the future. *Remember that while your mortgage payment will be fixed, other costs of home ownership will be variable. See below. You may or may not save money compared with rent over the period you live in your house, but by putting your money into a house, you have protected yourself against catastrophic rent increases. What is the cost of hedging yourself against this risk?",

          "text": "\nThe rent versus buy question is a deeply personal one in which your personal desires for a living space need to be carefully combined with what makes economic sense. Do you want your own place with all the joys of having it be yours and all the pains of having to handle all the maintenance and be the one ultimately responsible? Have you tried living for a few months putting aside the amount required for not only a mortgage payment but the taxes and insurance on a house/condo in your price range to see if you can really afford it? You can use a real estate website such as trulia to see the assessments of some for sale homes and figure out tax values. The average home insurance in the US is around $900/year if I remember right - more for homes that are more expensive and less for less expensive ones, with flooding and other hazards as a factor. Make sure you can afford to pay for all these items. From a financial perspective realize that you'll always be spending money on your living space. Even if you pay for a house with cash you will be paying property tax and maintenance and would be wise to continue paying for insurance. The value of the house at that point is, as contributor fennec often says, the rent you aren't paying. I personally don't recommend trying to time the market. You can't predict the future - will real estate in your area be a double dip or has it bottomed and is it going up? What you can do is buy a home only when you are sure that you can deal with its relative lack of liquidity by staying there for a long time. Five years is usually a reasonable minimum. There is a way that I recommend figuring out if it is likely bad financial decision to buy, and that's by looking at a financial comparison of renting versus buying. In some cases even with the bursting of the bubble it is still a bad deal to buy. DC went from renting being more cost effective to buying, but San Francisco is one area where buying is still not necessarily the best choice. To figure out what the case is for your area, look at the New York Times rent versus buy calculator. Find a home for rent on craigslist similar to what you'd look to buy.",

It's not like a stock or bond that you hold for a little while and then cash out for the profit.  You can own a home with as little as 3% down and as you pay for your living you pay it off.   Others argue that it is not a good investment because it is a single, indivisible, undiversified, and illiquid asset, and its value is tied to the local economy, which can lead to losses during a recession and housing bust. It is an expense/liability/asset. Therefore, whether a home is a good investment or not depends on various factors and individual financial goals.",

Rates are pretty tight, if one lender were more that 1/4% lower than another, they'd be inundated with applications. Above a certain credit score, you get the 'best' rate, a search will show you the rates offered in your area.  If you are a first time buyer, there are mortgages that might benefit you. If you are a vet (for non-native English readers, a veteran who served in the US armed forces, not a veterinarian, who is an animal doctor) there are mortgages that offer low-to-no down payment with attractive rates.  Yes, avoid PMI, it's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase. If banks qualify you for different amounts, it shouldn't be a huge difference, a few percent variation. But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36. But I wouldn't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase, that's asking for trouble.",

                    "model_text": "|user|: My friend wants to put my name down for a house he's buying. What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates. However, in a seller's market, buyers with VA loans may face challenges as some sellers might prefer offers with fewer barriers. Have you looked at conventional financing rather than VA? VA loans are not always a great deal. Conventional tends to be the best, and FHA being better than VA. It is also important to note that veterans can  make themselves more appealing to sellers with non-VA loans.\n|user|: Benefits of FHA loan?\n|assistant|: FHA is an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan. An FHA loan has several benefits. Firstly, it only requires a 3.5% down payment and allows for lower credit scores compared to traditional mortgages. This makes it a viable option for first-time homebuyers or those with limited credit history. Secondly, the PMI costs associated with FHA loans can be reduced by the size of the down payment. However, it's important to note that FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan, which can increase the overall cost of the mortgage.\n|user|: Do I need a real estate agent?\n|assistant|: Whether or not you need a real estate agent depends on your individual needs and circumstances. In the United States, the seller typically pays the real estate agent fee. If you don't have an agent, you may miss out on their expertise in explaining contract terms, advising you on making offers, the option to do inspections. While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls.\n|user|: How to become a real estate agent and does it pay?\n|assistant|: To become a real estate agent, you would typically need to take a pre-licensing course from a certified provider within your state, pass a licensing exam, and then complete a certain number of hours of post-licensing education. As for whether it pays, real estate agents typically make a commission of 3% to 3.5% of the sale price of a property, which can vary depending on the location and the sale price. However, earnings can be unpredictable and depend on various factors such as the number of transactions and the sale prices of the properties. And they only get paid if the house sells.\n|user|: Buying vs renting a home.\n|assistant|: The decision between buying and renting a home is a complex one that depends mostly on what makes economic sense. Pros of buying: - Building equity: When you buy a home, some of your monthly payment goes towards building equity in the property. - Tax benefits: Mortgage interest and property taxes are tax-deductible. - Freedom to customize: When you own a home, you have the freedom to customize it to your liking. - Stability: Owning a home can provide a sense of stability and security.

A lot depends on how much of that you do yourself - Lack of mobility: buying only makes sense if you stay in the house for 5 years or more. Pros of renting: Rent. If you have no idea whether you will still be in the same part of the country five years from now - Lower upfront costs: Renting typically requires less upfront costs compared to buying. - No responsibility for maintenance and repairs. Cons of renting: - No equity building. - Rent increases: Rents can increase over time. - Limited customization: Renters typically have limited ability to customize their living space.

Fannie May and Freddie Mac could care less, and FHA and VA backed loans allow for full gifting unless the buyer's credit is below the standard 620, then 3.5% must come from the buyer. Standard bank loans want to know the source of the down payment for ONE REASON ONLY: to know if the buyer is taking ON A NEW DEBT! The only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift.  That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale.

Once you get below 20% loan to value, you can petition the mortgage company to remove the PMI (with conventional loans; VA and FHA have lifetime PMI). If it was me, I'd do one of two things.  Both involve paying off the student loan now.  The savings from the student loan payment will assist you in helping you meet one of the two goals below.  Also both involve getting a 15 year fixed. The first would be to buy the house now, and work like crazy to get rid of the PMI.  My goal would be to get rid of this within 18 months.   The second would be to save up enough cash for the 20% down and then buy the house.  You'd miss out on the house you are looking at, which is kind of heartbreaking.  Who is to say that a better home does not come along at the same price?  My goal would be to have the downpayment in 9 months, and really try to have it in 6 months.

It is also important to note that veterans can  make themselves more appealing to sellers with non-VA loans.\n|user|: Benefits of FHA loan?\n|assistant|: FHA is an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan. An FHA loan has several benefits. Firstly, it only requires a 3.5% down payment and allows for lower credit scores compared to traditional mortgages. This makes it a viable option for first-time homebuyers or those with limited credit history. Secondly, the PMI costs associated with FHA loans can be reduced by the size of the down payment. However, it's important to note that FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan, which can increase the overall cost of the mortgage.\n|user|: Do I need a real estate agent?\n|assistant|: Whether or not you need a real estate agent depends on your individual needs and circumstances. In the United States, the seller typically pays the real estate agent fee. If you don't have an agent, you may miss out on their expertise in explaining contract terms, advising you on making offers, the option to do inspections. While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls.\n|user|: How to become a real estate agent and does it pay?\n|assistant|: To become a real estate agent, you would typically need to take a pre-licensing course from a certified provider within your state, pass a licensing exam, and then complete a certain number of hours of post-licensing education. As for whether it pays, real estate agents typically make a commission of 3% to 3.5% of the sale price of a property, which can vary depending on the location and the sale price. However, earnings can be unpredictable and depend on various factors such as the number of transactions and the sale prices of the properties. And they only get paid if the house sells.\n|user|: Buying vs renting a home.\n|assistant|: The decision between buying and renting a home is a complex one that depends mostly on what makes economic sense. Pros of buying: - Building equity: When you buy a home, some of your monthly payment goes towards building equity in the property. - Tax benefits: Mortgage interest and property taxes are tax-deductible. - Freedom to customize: When you own a home, you have the freedom to customize it to your liking. - Stability: Owning a home can provide a sense of stability and security. Cons of buying: - Upfront costs: Buying a home typically requires a significant down payment and closing costs. - Maintenance and repairs: Homeowners are responsible for maintenance and repairs. A lot depends on how much of that you do yourself - Lack of mobility: buying only makes sense if you stay in the house for 5 years or more. Pros of renting: Rent. If you have no idea whether you will still be in the same part of the country five years from now - Lower upfront costs: Renting typically requires less upfront costs compared to buying. - No responsibility for maintenance and repairs. Cons of renting: - No equity building. - Rent increases: Rents can increase over time. - Limited customization: Renters typically have limited ability to customize their living space. Consider your individual needs, circumstances, and financial situation when making the decision between buying and renting.\n|user|: Is a home a good investment?"

Owning housing as an investment property is a horrible idea, and anyone who does it, especially right now with as bubbly as the market is looking again, (or, better put, still, since the last bubble never did fully pop and clear out the underlying systemic instability,) is an idiot. And even after the current housing market bubble pops, it's likely to remain a bad idea for decades.  We're never getting the early 2000s back, for basic supply-and-demand reasons: with the Baby Boom generation retiring, aging and dying off, they're not likely to do much more home-buying, and no generation after them is as big as they are, which means a glut of oversupply and weak demand for the entirety of the foreseeable future.\"",

This gives it different characteristics than other investments (e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home doesn't do much to assist your financial well-being and future income, and isn't necessarily the \"\"responsible\"\" thing to do). You may get some capital gains, typically in line with inflation, sometimes less, sometimes more, but those aren't the most reliable, and it's difficult to realize them (it involves selling your house and moving). Its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent. But if you're still working full-time and can expect cost-of-living increases, that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to, say, someone living on a fixed income. But as for treating it as a \"\"low-risk investment\"\"? That's very problematic. Real low-risk investments are things like government bonds, where you can't lose principal. Unless you're going to live into your house until the day you die, the real estate crash should have disabused you of any notion that housing values never go down. Rather, your house is a single, indivisible, undiversified, illiquid investment. Imagine, if you will, going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust... then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties. Also, you can't sell any of it until you move away, and the transaction fee will take something like 3%. Still sound \"\"safe\"\"? Moreover, it's exactly the wrong kind of risk. Your house's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is, which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy. This means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy, you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time. It totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent, and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations. \"\"Safety\"\" is not the way you should be thinking of it, though.\"",

The question about what is a better investment is subjective, something you invest in has the ability to grow in value. So examples of investments would be buying stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. When it comes down to it, long-term investments pay better than short-term ones. If nothing else, there's less administration and less financial risk for the provider. Stocks, bonds, and mutual funds offer diversification, liquidity, and potential for higher returns, but also come with market risk and volatility.

But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36.

What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates.

While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls.\n|user|: How to become a real estate agent and does it pay?\n|assistant|: To become a real estate agent, you would typically need to take a pre-licensing course from a certified provider within your state, pass a licensing exam, and then complete a certain number of hours of post-licensing education. As for whether it pays, real estate agents typically make a commission of 3% to 3.5% of the sale price of a property, which can vary depending on the location and the sale price.

The only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift.  That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale.

                    "model_text": "|user|: My friend wants to put my name down for a house he's buying. What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates. However, in a seller's market, buyers with VA loans may face challenges as some sellers might prefer offers with fewer barriers. Have you looked at conventional financing rather than VA? VA loans are not always a great deal. Conventional tends to be the best, and FHA being better than VA. It is also important to note that veterans can  make themselves more appealing to sellers with non-VA loans.\n|user|: Benefits of FHA loan?\n|assistant|: FHA is an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan. An FHA loan has several benefits. Firstly, it only requires a 3.5% down payment and allows for lower credit scores compared to traditional mortgages. This makes it a viable option for first-time homebuyers or those with limited credit history. Secondly, the PMI costs associated with FHA loans can be reduced by the size of the down payment. However, it's important to note that FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan, which can increase the overall cost of the mortgage.\n|user|: Do I need a real estate agent?\n|assistant|: Whether or not you need a real estate agent depends on your individual needs and circumstances. In the United States, the seller typically pays the real estate agent fee. If you don't have an agent, you may miss out on their expertise in explaining contract terms, advising you on making offers, the option to do inspections. While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls.\n|user|: How to become a real estate agent and does it pay?\n|assistant|: To become a real estate agent, you would typically need to take a pre-licensing course from a certified provider within your state, pass a licensing exam, and then complete a certain number of hours of post-licensing education. As for whether it pays, real estate agents typically make a commission of 3% to 3.5% of the sale price of a property, which can vary depending on the location and the sale price. However, earnings can be unpredictable and depend on various factors such as the number of transactions and the sale prices of the properties. And they only get paid if the house sells.\n|user|: Buying vs renting a home.\n|assistant|: The decision between buying and renting a home is a complex one that depends mostly on what makes economic sense. Pros of buying: - Building equity: When you buy a home, some of your monthly payment goes towards building equity in the property. - Tax benefits: Mortgage interest and property taxes are tax-deductible. - Freedom to customize: When you own a home, you have the freedom to customize it to your liking. - Stability: Owning a home can provide a sense of stability and security. Cons of buying: - Upfront costs: Buying a home typically requires a significant down payment and closing costs. - Maintenance and repairs: Homeowners are responsible for maintenance and repairs. A lot depends on how much of that you do yourself - Lack of mobility: buying only makes sense if you stay in the house for 5 years or more. Pros of renting: Rent. If you have no idea whether you will still be in the same part of the country five years from now - Lower upfront costs: Renting typically requires less upfront costs compared to buying. - No responsibility for maintenance and repairs. Cons of renting: - No equity building. - Rent increases: Rents can increase over time. - Limited customization: Renters typically have limited ability to customize their living space. Consider your individual needs, circumstances, and financial situation when making the decision between buying and renting.\n|user|: Is a home a good investment?\n|assistant|: A home is an investment, but the value it returns isn't primarily.  Your home should be worth more to you than its market value. It is YOUR HOME. It's where you come home every day to your family, where you build a life. Yes it's an investment, but it's not like a stock or bond that you hold for a little while and then cash out for the profit. A home is the first and best investment, you can own a home with as little as 3% down and as you pay for your living you pay it off.   However, others argue that it is not a good investment because it is a single, indivisible, undiversified, and illiquid asset, and its value is tied to the local economy, which can lead to losses during a recession and housing bust. Your home (the one you live in) is not an investment. Its an expense/liability/asset. Therefore, whether a home is a good investment or not depends on various factors and individual financial goals.\n|user|: What is a better investment?"

Once you get below 20% loan to value, you can petition the mortgage company to remove the PMI (with conventional loans; VA and FHA have lifetime PMI). If it was me, I'd do one of two things.  Both involve paying off the student loan now.  The savings from the student loan payment will assist you in helping you meet one of the two goals below.  Also both involve getting a 15 year fixed. The first would be to buy the house now, and work like crazy to get rid of the PMI.  My goal would be to get rid of this within 18 months.   The second would be to save up enough cash for the 20% down and then buy the house.  You'd miss out on the house you are looking at, which is kind of heartbreaking.  Who is to say that a better home does not come along at the same price?  My goal would be to have the downpayment in 9 months, and really try to have it in 6 months. Being an old guy that has experience how much of a virtue patience is, I'd recommend the second option.",

Real estate, including homes, can be a good investment as it can provide rental income, appreciation, and tax benefits. However, it also requires significant upfront costs, maintenance, and illiquidity. On the other hand, stocks, bonds, and mutual funds offer diversification, liquidity, and potential for higher returns, but also come with market risk and volatility. It's essential to consult with a financial advisor or do thorough research before making any investment decisions."
