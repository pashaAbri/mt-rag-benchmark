NAV reflects the value of the company's assets if it were to sell everything, pay off its debts, and shut down. While Market Cap represents current market sentiment and future expectations, NAV provides a measure of the company's tangible asset value per share. These two values often differ significantly, especially for companies expected to grow or those with substantial intangible assets.

Which is why there are always sellers for the buyers of a stock, and vice-versa.  From your question, we agree that NAV can be measured, it's the result of adding up things that are all known. (For now, let's ignore things such as \"\"goodwill.\"\") Rarely is a stock price simply equal to the NAV divided by the number of shares. Often, it's quite higher. The simplest way to look at it is that the stock price not only reflects the NAV, but investors' expectations looking into the future.  If you look for two companies with identical NAV per share but quite different share prices, you'll see that the companies differ in that one might be a high growth company, the other, a solid one but with a market that's not in such a growth mode.\"",

If you don't you'll be relying on little more than dumb luck to carry you through - which in this area of business, you don't want to do because the dollar amounts and liabilities involved can bankrupt you in no time flat. With that general advice out of the way, here's a tiny nutshell version of valuation of commercial real estate. There are a few key parts involved in commercial real estate: land, improvements (buildings, docks, stuff like that), income, and wages. Land: the value of the land is based upon what you could sell it for, as-is. That is to say - who else might want it? This alone has many important factors, such as zoning laws, the neighborhood (including your neighbors), water/utilities, pacts on the land (someone may have insisted the land not be paved into a parking lot, or really anything like that), alternative uses (could you put a golf course on it, or is the land suitable for a big building or farming?), etc. And is this in a growing area, where you might hope the value will increase over the next decade, or decrease, or basically stay flat (and possibly cause losses compared to inflation)? Improvements: anything on the land is both an asset and a liability. It's an asset because it could add to the value of the land, but it might also reduce the land value if it interferes with alternate land uses. It's a liability, both in the legal sense and in that it requires maintenance. If you want to rent them out, especially, that means concern about any foundations involved, termites, roofs, sewage/septic tanks, utilities that are your responsibility (pipes, poles, wires), as well as any sort of ac/heating you may have, docks, and so on. These things are rarely free and absolutely can eat you alive. Income: Ah, the best part, the constant influx of cash! But wait, is it a constant influx?",

For instance, the value of a stock is solely determined by the price people are willing to pay for it and the price at which those who have it are willing to sell.

In some ways it is just a question of world-view as much as anything but the concepts of natural prices or innate worth are difficult to argue against. At the same time, without exchange the concept of value has little meaning. So, as usual, it is some sophistry mixed with some sense.  Both have elements of truth and both are considerably more complex than they seem at first. Interestingly though, neither seems to work very well as predictive models despite providing the basis for some incredibly complex and interesting mathematical workups.       * Note that net labor is the sum of ALL labor involved and is incredibly difficult to quantify accurately.",

These ratios help investors understand whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued compared to its financial performance and asset value.\nWhen considering the value of a business, it's essential to look beyond just the financial figures. Factors like the company's reputation, competitive position, growth potential, and the quality of its management team can significantly impact its overall worth.

Capitalism rewards the positive results of proper decision making in the market place as businesses generate enough profit to allow them to stay afloat and expand, while those businesses that do not follow through with proper decision making reap negative results, fail and eventually go out of business. These are irrefutable facts which govern how capitalism works, i.e. success is rewarded, failure is punished and both of these results serve as lessons for all others in the marketplace who dare to heed these lessons based offered up by success and failure which are to be found in a capitalist economy.   So if the current market conditions dictate that allowing workers more free time, increased perks, etc will increase productivity and lead to success then it is only rational and reasonable for businesses to attend to the needs of their employees.   However if the costs of these perks begin to spiral out of control and/or are no longer relevant or favorable in the marketplace then cost cutting measures are needed to ensure that businesses are able to secure their profits and stay afloat. Those who do not rein in or alleviate these cost issues in their businesses will quickly go under as these costs eat out their bottom line and competitors move in to under-cut them in the market place. Nevertheless attempting to place some sort of emotional or political reasoning and judgment as to how and why businesses act in regards to cost cutting measures without first taking into account the reality of the circumstances in which they must operate in, i.e. having to make a profit in order to survive, is unreasonable and flat out childish.\"",

There are 5000 shares outstanding, so each founder owns half. They hire four employees in year one. These four employees each take 250 shares. There are 6000 shares outstanding. They hire another 20 employees in year two. Each one takes 50 shares. They get fewer shares because they took less risk, and they get 50 shares because we're giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up. By the time the company has six layers, you have given out 10,000 shares. Each founder ends up owning 25%. Each employee layer owns 10% collectively.",

This not only helps in maintaining a positive work environment but also contributes to the overall growth and success of the business. Employees who feel valued and appreciated are more likely to be productive and contribute positively to the decision-making process of the business. Therefore, while profits are essential for a business to survive, it is equally important to prioritize the well-being and satisfaction of employees."

Understanding the business and the metrics associated with its stock is also crucial.\nRegarding the control of a company, purchasing a significant portion of the shares may allow you to control the company, but it depends on various factors such as the company's structure and the types of shares outstanding.\nAs for the value of a stock, it's determined by the price people are willing to pay for it. Different economic theories have different views on the determination of value.\nIn terms of decision-making in business, it's driven by the pursuit of profit. Business owners must constantly re-evaluate the current and future climate. While goodwill and good intentions are important, they do not always equate to positive results.\nEmployees are a vital part of a business. As the company grows, it's important to keep adding people in layers and ensuring they feel part of something more than just a job.\nThe decision to sell a business depends on various factors such as the profitability of the business, your interest in expanding it, the alignment of the stock with your strategy, and the demand for the industry in which the business operates."
