It\u2019s in the ground, forms big oceans, and it\u2019s in our atmosphere.\nIt\u2019s also in living things. Your body is made up mostly of water.\nWater covers 71 percent of Earth\u2019s surface. And almost all of it\u201496.5 percent\u2014is salt water. \nSalt water has different kinds of salt in it, but it mostly has sodium chloride, the same salt we add to our food.\nJust 3.5 percent of the water on Earth is fresh water we can drink. And most of that fresh water, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers.\nA third of the fresh water is in the ground. We call it groundwater. The last two percent of fresh water is in the rivers, lakes, and streams.\nA very small amount is in our atmosphere, where it exists as water vapor. That\u2019s what clouds are made of.\nIf you took all the water on Earth and put it together it would be a ball 860 miles wide.

The requirement for TMDLs was largely ignored by federal and state water quality\r\nagencies until the early 1990s. Until then, water quality regulation had been focused on controlling point sources of pollution through state and federal\r\npermitting programs. Although water quality had been improving, over 40 percent of assessed water bodies nationwide remained too polluted for fishing or\r\nswimming. It became apparent that the remaining water pollution problems\u2014largely associated with nonpoint source pollution\u2014required different solutions. The\r\nactivation of the TMDL program in the 1990s, in part instigated by lawsuits against the federal government to enforce the TMDL requirements, provides a\r\nplanning framework to address these problems.\nCurrent State List of Impaired Water Bodies. The most recent list of impaired water bodies in the state (1998) lists 509 impaired water bodies for which 1,471\r\nTMDLs have to be developed.",

Cleaning up contaminated groundwater can be a costly and time-consuming process, emphasizing the importance of preventing contamination in the first place."

The use of toxic chemical pesticides or neglecting vehicular maintenance, can further pollute our water supply. These substances inevitably end up in our waterways, contaminating local lakes, rivers, streams and the ocean. Thankfully, there are simple steps all of us can take to reduce stormwater pollution and help keep our water clean.\nCalifornians can positively impact the environment by taking necessary steps to minimize contributions to water pollution. The \u201cLet\u2019s Change This to That\u201d campaign via CleanWaterCA.com\u00a0provides a list of tips to help support clean water from summer to winter and all year round. They include:\nPick up after your pet. A common misconception is that pet waste is a natural fertilizer and can be left to decompose in the environment. Not so! Pet waste can contain harmful bacteria such as E. coli and fecal coliform, which can carry diseases that affect wildlife and contaminate waterways when not properly disposed of.\nSave water. Reduce water pollution by sweeping your driveway instead of using the hose and, if you can, by washing your car at a facility. The United States Environmental Protection Agency warns that washing cars and driveways at home can cause pollution as metals and fluids are washed off and enter storm drains, collecting more pollutants along the way and ending up in our waterways. If you can, choose car wash facilities that use advanced filtration systems to recycle water used for washing cars.\nGo organic. This summer consider using natural pest control methods instead of harmful pesticides. Pesticides made from highly toxic chemicals can have long-lasting effects on the health of our water and the environment. By choosing organic alternatives, like companion planting or using beneficial insects like ladybugs, you can make a difference.\nGive your vehicle a tune-up. Vehicle fluids, oils and brake dust are made up of toxic heavy metals that end up on roadways and highways if we don\u2019t provide proper maintenance.",
