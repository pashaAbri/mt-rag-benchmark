          "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nThe \"solid oxide\" in a solid oxide electrolyzer cell is a ceramic made mostly of zirconia that is heated to 1,472 degrees Fahrenheit (800 degrees Celsius) inside a special miniature oven. When MOXIE runs, it first has to heat up that ceramic to its operating temperature. That takes about two hours. The rover batteries have enough available charge left to make oxygen for about an hour after that. During that hour, we sometimes change the voltage or the compressor speed to learn more about the instrument.\nWhen MOXIE runs, very little else gets done on Perseverance. There isn't enough power left to drive, or to abrade rocks, or even to run the other instruments for very long. So MOXIE doesn't run very often, maybe once every one or two months.\n\nWhat do we hope to learn from MOXIE?\n\nMOXIE's main job is to show that we can rely on this technology to keep future crews of astronauts alive and return them home safely. That's a tall order. But more than that, we hope to learn a lot of technical details about how to build that much larger future MOXIE system. For that purpose, we include in MOXIE lots of sensors and controls that help us learn about how well MOXIE is doing and how to make it better.\n\nWhat would a full-size MOXIE look like?\n\nEarth and Mars line up for a trip every 26 months. When we send an astronaut crew to Mars, one idea is to send all the things they'll need \u2013 a place to live, rovers, a power plant, and maybe a \"Big MOXIE\" \u2013 on one launch opportunity, then send the astronauts on the next opportunity, 26 months later. If we do that, then the base would be in place for about 20 months before the astronauts start their trip. The goal of a Big MOXIE would be to make and store all the oxygen that the astronaut and their rocket would need for their mission before they even launch. That means the Big MOXIE would need to make 2,000 to 3,000 grams of oxygen per hour, compared to the 6-10 grams that the current MOXIE is making.",

          "text": "Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) - NASA Mars\nThat destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called \u2013 coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin. In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there \u2013 on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity.",

The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'\nFuel needs oxygen to burn\u2014for example, on Earth, oxygen is constantly being converted to carbon dioxide by animals, or fires, or other chemical reactions. Plants and trees use water and sunlight to convert the carbon dioxide back to oxygen, replenishing the air. On Mars, MOXIE also makes oxygen from carbon dioxide, about as much as a modest-sized tree, though using a very different process.\n\nMOXIE is a Scale Model for a Future Big MOXIE\nTo launch from Mars, a small crew of human explorers will need 25 to 30 tons of oxygen, or about the weight of a tractor-trailer! To make that much oxygen would require a 25,000 to 30,000 watt power plant. The Perseverance power system only provides about 100 watts, so MOXIE can only make a small fraction of the oxygen that a future \"Big MOXIE\" would need to make.\n\nMOXIE is a 'Tech Demo'\nNASA uses technical demonstrations, or tech demos, when it's not enough to just test a critical technology in the laboratory and it needs to be proven on an actual mission.\n\nWhere Is MOXIE Located?\n\nMichael Hecht\nPrincipal Investigator\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\nCambridge, Massachusetts\n\nDid You Know?\nMOXIE uses a device called an \"electrolyzer\" to make oxygen from the carbon dioxide in the air. An electrolyzer is a close cousin to a fuel cell, which is a device we use to directly make electricity from fuel and oxygen. You can think of MOXIE as a fuel cell running in reverse. \n\nFor Scientists\nNASA is preparing for human exploration of Mars, and the MOXIE investigation on the Mars 2020 mission aims to address key knowledge gaps.\nRead More \u203a",

In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity. A hydrogen cell of this type, in contrast, would start with the water and use electricity to turn it back into hydrogen and oxygen. The two devices, the fuel cell and the electrolyzer, are nearly identical devices, operated in a very different way.\nUsing water to make oxygen on Mars would be a great idea if we had easy access to the water. But to get water, we would have to travel to the far north or south to find ice, or to mine for ice buried deep in the ground. Fortunately, though, another source of oxygen is all around us, in the form of the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the Martian air. So instead of using hydrogen, MOXIE is an example of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell that uses carbon dioxide to make the gasses carbon monoxide and oxygen. \n\nWhy will we need oxygen on Mars?\n\nThe first human crew to go to Mars will need a lot of oxygen to breathe, as much as 2 to 3 tons. Our bodies use that oxygen to burn our fuel, which we call \"food,\" in order to make the energy that keeps us going all day. But it's not just humans who need oxygen. Nearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit.",

Oxygen is only 0.13%, compared to 21% in Earth's atmosphere. If we want oxygen on Mars, we either have to bring it along, or make it ourselves.\n\nFuel Needs Oxygen to Burn\nOn Earth, we are always getting energy from the reaction between oxygen and whatever fuel we are using \u2014 whether it's a log in a campfire or gasoline in a car tank. The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'",

In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there \u2013 on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse.

An electrolyzer is a close cousin to a fuel cell, which is a device we use to directly make electricity from fuel and oxygen. You can think of MOXIE as a fuel cell running in reverse. \n\nFor Scientists\nNASA is preparing for human exploration of Mars, and the MOXIE investigation on the Mars 2020 mission aims to address key knowledge gaps.\nRead More \u203a\n\nThe Story Behind the Name\nMOXIE stands for the Mars OXygen ISRU Experiment. ISRU is another acronym, In Situ Resource Utilization, which is a technical way of describing what most of us call \"living off the land.\"\nThe word \"moxie,\" used to describe someone with spunk and audacity, came from the soft drink of the same name. The soft drink, Moxie, was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works. You can still buy Moxie in New England, and it's considered the official drink of the state of Maine.\nThe connection with soft drinks doesn't end there. According to some accounts, the Moxie company was the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy. On Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make \u2013 well, anything at all. Another connection is more technical. Whenever we run MOXIE, we need to be very careful with the settings to make sure we only produce carbon monoxide (CO), and not pure carbon, which would ruin it. That destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called \u2013 coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin.

Oxygen is only 0.13%, compared to 21% in Earth's atmosphere. If we want oxygen on Mars, we either have to bring it along, or make it ourselves.\n\nFuel Needs Oxygen to Burn\nOn Earth, we are always getting energy from the reaction between oxygen and whatever fuel we are using \u2014 whether it's a log in a campfire or gasoline in a car tank. The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'",

In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there \u2013 on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity.",

          "text": "History\nThe Mars Surveyor program came to an end in 2000, after the failure of two missions launched in 1998, the Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander.Mars Observer's loss also helped enable NASA to gain approval for another planetary mission program, known as Discovery. The Discovery Program required NASA centers and university-based scientists to submit proposals to competitions that were to be held every few years. To get the program going, the first two Discovery missions were assigned. JPL was awarded Mars Pathfinder. The Mars Pathfinder mission introduced what has become a powerful technology for planetary exploration: the planetary rover. The USSR had landed robotic rovers on the Moon, and it had tried to land a miniature rover on Mars in the 1970s but had failed. Mars Pathfinder's micro-rover, named Sojourner, for abolitionist Sojourner Truth, in 1997 became the first robotic rover to explore the Red Planet. The Sojourner rover sampling a convenient rock next to the Mars Pathfinder lander. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Mars Pathfinder also pioneered a new policy of releasing imagery to the public in almost real time, via the newly public World Wide Web. Finally, Mars Pathfinder was also inexpensive, and justified an agency drive to reduce the cost of planetary missions even further.After the failures of the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander, NASA approved the Mars Exploration Rover mission, whose two rovers were named \"Spirit\" and \"Opportunity\" after their launch in July 2003. The two were equipped for robotic geology, looking for signs that liquid water having ever existed on the surface. They operated until 2010 and 2018, respectively, roving nearly nearly 33 miles (53 kilometers) between them. Among their many spectacular findings: at some time in Mars' deep past, water had flowed on the surface. Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity looks back at its lander shell in 2004. Credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell NASA also approved a large orbiter to help discover suitable landing sites for a future Mars sample return project. That orbiter mission became the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched in 2005.The next rover, eventually named \"Curiosity,\" was equipped for even more detailed investigation of Mars' ancient minerals and geology. It arrived on Mars on Aug. 6, 2012, and was still operating in 2020.",

Perseverance is also designed to collect and store rock samples on the Martian surface for retrieval by a future Mars sample return mission, formally approved by NASA in 2019. Perseverance also hosts a robotic helicopter named Ingenuity, a technology demonstration mission that will attempt powered flight on another planet.Competing for the planetsJPL was awarded a number of other Discovery program missions after Mars Pathfinder. The Stardust mission collected particles from comet Wild-2 in 2004, while the Genesis mission returned some particles from the solar wind in 2004. The Deep Impact mission launched a kinetic impactor at Comet Tempel 1 to assess its structure and composition in 2005. The GRAIL mission, based on the GRACE gravity satellites, produced very high resolution gravity maps of the Moon, while the Dawn mission used solar-electric propulsion to visit the dwarf planet Ceres and the largest main belt asteroid, Vesta.
