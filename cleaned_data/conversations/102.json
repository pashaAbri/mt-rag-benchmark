[Ballot]\nSeveral California cities\u2014including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose\u2014and some unincorporated communities have laws that limit how much landlords can increase rents for housing from one year to the next. These laws often are called rent control. About one-quarter of Californians live in communities with rent control. Local rent boards carry out rent control. These boards are paid for with fees on landlords.\nCourt Rulings Limit Local Rent Control.\u00a0Courts have ruled that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a \u201cfair rate of return.\u201d This means that landlords must be allowed to increase rents enough to receive some profit each year.\nState Law Limits Local Rent Control.\u00a0A state law, known as the\u00a0Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act\u00a0(Costa-Hawkins), limits local rent control laws. Costa-Hawkins creates three main limitations. First, rent control cannot apply to any single-family homes. Second, rent control cannot apply to any newly built housing completed on or after February 1, 1995. Third, rent control laws cannot tell landlords what they can charge a new renter when first moving in.\nState Law Limits Rent Increases.\u00a0In addition to any local rent control laws in place as allowed by Costa-Hawkins, a more recent state law also limits rent increases for most rental housing in California. Landlords cannot increase rent by more than 5\u00a0percent plus inflation in a year, or 10\u00a0percent, whichever is lower. This applies to most housing that is more than 15 years old. This law lasts until January 1, 2030.\nState and Local Government Tax Revenues.\u00a0Three taxes are the largest sources of tax revenue for the state and local governments in California\u2014personal income tax, property tax, and sales tax. The state collects a personal income tax on income\u2014including rent received by landlords\u2014earned within the state. Local governments levy property taxes on property owners based on the value of their property. The state and local governments collect sales taxes on the retail sale of goods.\nProposal\nRepeals Costa-Hawkins. The measure repeals the limits on local rent control laws in Costa-Hawkins. Under the measure, cities and counties can regulate rents for any housing.",

This would increase their income tax payments. The overall effect on state income tax revenue is not clear.\n\nOverall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues over time. The largest effect would be on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure. For example, if communities that already have rent control expand their rules to include newer homes and single-family homes, revenue losses could be in the high tens of millions of dollars per year. If many communities create new rent control rules, revenue losses could be larger. If few communities make changes, revenue losses would be more limited and dependent on the scope of rent control laws that automatically expanded in response to the repeal of Costa-Hawkins.\nIncreased Local Government Costs.\u00a0If cities or counties create new rent control laws or expand existing ones, local rent boards would have increased costs. For communities where rent control laws expand automatically, costs also could increase. Depending on local government choices, these costs could\u00a0range from very little to tens of millions of dollars per year. These costs likely would be paid by fees on owners of rental housing.\nSummary of Fiscal Effects. We estimate that this measure would have the following major fiscal effect:\n\nOverall, a potential reduction in state and local revenues in the high tens of millions of dollars per year over time. Depending on actions by local communities, revenue losses could be less or more.\n\nSubscribe\r\n | California State Legislature \r\n | Online Voter Registration\r\n | Privacy Policy\r\n | Accessibility\n\nLegislative Analyst's Office | The California Legislature's Nonpartisan Fiscal and Policy Advisor\r\n \r\n 925 L Street, Suite 1000 Sacramento, CA 95814 | (916) 445-4656 | information [at] lao.ca.gov",

To qualify for a more affordable \"bottom-tier\" home, the annual income needed is over 50% higher than the median income. The California Housing Finance Agency (CHFA) originally offered a first-time home buyer program limited to low-income households, but due to few households in this income bracket being able to purchase homes, the program has been expanded to include moderate-income households.

These changes were incorporated into\r\nChapter 127, effective beginning July 1, 2000. For the sales price limit program, very few homes in California were being constructed for less than the original purchase price limit of $110,000.\r\nTherefore, the limit was raised to $130,000 and is now adjusted annually for changes in statewide home sales prices. The first-time home buyer program was originally limited to households of\r\nlow-income. Few households of this income level, however, are in the position of purchasing homes. Thus, this program was expanded to include moderate-income households.\n\nAs of September 2000, home buyers in 22 counties had received funding from the state. Four counties\u2014Fresno, Kern, Riverside, and Tulare\u2014represent more than 60 percent of the\r\nsingle-family programs' expenditures. The concentration of applicants in the Central Valley should not be particularly surprising, given that this area is one of California's fastest growing housing\r\nmarkets and often relies on the use of developer fees to finance new school construction.\nMultifamily Program. Likewise, the multifamily housing program has had limited success in funding applicants. From its allocation of $32.5 million so far, seven projects have been funded for\r\na total of $1.1 million, and another 34 projects have been approved with expected expenditures of $3.7 million. Due to the complexities of multifamily affordable housing financing and\r\nconstruction, the program takes a particularly long time to move from initial application to finished construction\u2014typically a minimum of one year.\nConcerns About the Programs \nOur review of these housing assistance programs indicates a number of concerns with their operation, which we discuss below.\nLack of Applications Threatens Viability of Programs. Without a dramatic expansion in home buyer and multifamily developer interest in the programs, the programs will continue to be an\r\nineffective effort to increase housing affordability.

[Ballot]\nThe value of rental housing would decline because potential landlords would not want to pay as much for these properties.\nSome renters would spend less on rent and some landlords would receive less rental income.\nSome renters would move less often. For example, fewer renters would move because their rents increase.\n\nThe size of these effects would depend on how many communities pass new laws (or have existing rent control laws that could immediately become effective), and the type and scope of rent control adopted. If many localities enacted rent regulation that significantly limited rents, other economic effects locally and statewide (such as impacts on housing construction) could occur.\nChanges in State and Local Revenues.\u00a0The measure\u2019s economic effects would affect property tax, sales tax, and income tax revenues. The largest and most likely impacts are:\n\nLess Property Taxes Paid by Landlords.\u00a0A decline in the value of rental properties would lead to a decrease in property tax payments made by owners of those properties over time. These property tax losses would be partially offset by higher property tax payments resulting from the sales of rental housing. This is because property sales often cause property tax bills to reset at a higher level. Revenue losses from lower property values would be larger than revenue gains from increased sales. Because of this, the measure would reduce overall property tax payments over time.\nMore Sales Taxes Paid by Renters.\u00a0Renters who pay less in rent would use some of their savings to buy taxable goods.\nChange in Income Taxes Paid by Landlords.\u00a0Landlords\u2019 income tax payments would change in several ways, both up and down.\u00a0Some landlords would receive less rental income. This would reduce their income tax payments. On the other hand, over time, landlords would pay less to buy rental properties. This would reduce expenses they can claim to lower their income tax payments (such as mortgage interest, property taxes, and depreciation). This would increase their income tax payments. The overall effect on state income tax revenue is not clear.\n\nOverall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues over time. The largest effect would be on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure.",

      "original_text": "The document discusses issues related to housing in California, including both home buyers and renters. For renters, several California cities and unincorporated communities have laws that limit how much landlords can increase rents for housing from one year to the next. These laws, often called rent control, apply to about one-quarter of Californians. However, courts have ruled that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a \"fair rate of return,\" meaning that landlords must be allowed to increase rents enough to receive some profit each year. Additionally, a state law called the Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act limits local rent control laws by preventing rent control from applying to single-family homes, newly built housing completed on or after February 1, 1995, and by prohibiting rent control laws from telling landlords what they can charge a new renter when first moving in. A more recent state law also limits rent increases for most rental housing in California, with landlords not being able to increase rent by more than 5% plus inflation in a year, or 10%, whichever is lower."

As part of implementing CCR, the state developed a new foster care maintenance payment rates structure to replace the previous age-based and group home rates structure. Under CCR, foster care rates must be based on the assessed level of need of individual youth (\u201clevel of care\u201d), with youth requiring higher levels of behavioral health supports and other more therapeutic and intensive services receiving higher rates. Since 2017, the state has been implementing interim level of care (LOC) rates for resource families, Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Programs (STRTPs), Foster Family Agencies (FFAs), Intensive Services Foster Care (ISFC), and other specialized models of foster care. Statute specifies that the interim rates will expire December 31, 2024 and that the permanent, ongoing LOC rates structure will be established by January 1, 2025. In working toward meeting this statutory requirement, alongside the 2024-25 Governor\u2019s budget, DSS has shared an initial concept paper outlining a new proposed framework for the permanent rates structure.\nCurrent Rates Structure Relies on Level of Care Protocol (LOCP).",

The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) administers various rental housing and homeownership programs to assist low-income households. One such program is the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA), which offers several loan products to help first-time homebuyers with low to moderate incomes. Additionally, the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), helps eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities afford safe and sanitary housing. Participants typically pay around 30% of their income for rent, and the voucher covers the rest. However, waiting lists for these programs can be long due to high demand."

The intent of this change was to make the program self-funded. That is, program costs are paid for with loan repayments without general taxpayer support.

When the fund balance exceeds this threshold\u2014as it did from 2017-2018 through 2019-2020 by a total of $7.9 million\u2014those funds are transferred to the General Fund. Third, in order to qualify, homeowners must have at least 40 percent equity in the home.\nReduced Interest Rates and Raised Income Eligibility Threshold in 2019.\u00a0 The Legislature modified the program in 2019, including reducing interest rates on the loans (7 percent to 5 percent), raising income eligibility thresholds ($35,000 per year to $45,000 per year and growing with inflation), and expanding the program to include manufactured homes.\n\nProposal\nBudget Proposes $7.5 Million General Fund Transfer to the PTP Fund. The Governor\u2019s budget would provide the Department of Finance authority to transfer $7.5 million from the General Fund to the PTP Fund to ensure there are adequate resources available to cover costs in 2024-25. (This transfer is located in budget item 9100-111-0001.)

Specifically, DFEH has responsibility for enforcing the state's main equal opportunity law, the Fair Employment and Housing Act, and resolving complaints in a timely manner.\nThe budget proposes expenditures of $22.4 million ($18.3 million from the General Fund and $4.1 million federal funds) for support of the department in 2001-02. This represents an increase\r\nof $363,000 (1.6 percent) over estimated current-year expenditures.\nInsufficient Justification of Increased Funding \nWe recommend the Legislature delete a total of $151,000 and two positions because the department has not provided workload information for the requested positions.\r\n(Delete $151,000 in Item 1700-001-0001.)\nNo Workload Data for Restrictive Covenant Program. The budget includes $151,000 from the General Fund for two positions to administer a new restrictive covenant identification\r\nservice, as authorized by Chapter 291, Statutes of 1999 (AB 1493, Nakano). Restrictive covenants under this program are those that limit property ownership based on race, color, religion,\r\nsex, familial status, marital status, disability, national origin, and ancestry, and violate the state's fair housing laws. Under this program, the department, upon request by property owners, reviews\r\nproperty deeds to determine if they contain racially restrictive covenants. According to the department, caseload tracking and processing will need to be developed for this activity. However,\r\nthe department has provided no workload data indicating the number of requests expected under the program or the amount of time it will take to process the requests. Until the department\r\nbegins administering the program, it is not clear that additional staff or resources are required. We recommend the department implement the program using existing resources during the budget\r\nyear and evaluate the workload during that time. If sufficient workload develops, a future request for staff and resources may be justified. Consequently, we recommend the Legislature delete\r\n$151,000 and two positions in Item 1700-001-0001.\n\nReturn to General Government Table of Contents,\r\n2001-02 Budget Analysis\n\n",

The 2000-01 budget contained $39 million for two components of EHAP:\n\nOperating Grants. $14 million of the funds are available to fund the ongoing services of homeless shelters. This level of funding\r\nis again proposed for 2001-02.\nCapital Loans. Forgivable loans totaling $25 million are available for the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of shelter\r\nfacilities.\n\nOther Programs \nCode Enforcement Incentives. Two new programs\u2014designed to improve local enforcement of building codes\u2014were created by\r\nChapter 664, Statutes of 2000 (AB 1382, Lowenthal), and appropriated $5 million in one-time funds. The department has received\r\nabout $30 million in applications for the two programs.\n\nCode Enforcement Incentive Program. This program ($2.75 million) provides three-year grants to local jurisdictions to\r\nincrease staffing for local code enforcement activities. The maximum grant amount is $1 million, and local matching funds must\r\nincrease over the life of the grant.\n Community Code Enforcement Pilot Program. This program ($2.25 million), with a maximum grant amount of $450,000,\r\nemphasizes improving cooperation between code enforcement officials and prosecution agencies, health departments, housing\r\nagencies, and schools.\n\nInterregional Partnership Pilot Program. This program, funded at $5 million, will provide grants to assist local governments\r\nundertaking interregional planning for housing and employment issues, with a particular emphasis on improving geographic mapping.\nChild Care Facilities. The budget appropriated $16 million for the Child Care Facilities Financing Program. The funds can be\r\nused for either direct loans or loan guarantees for child care facility purchases, expansions, or renovations. In the 2000-01 Analysis,\r\nwe reported that the program was having administrative difficulties in distributing $7 million in funds appropriated in the 1997-98\r\nbudget.",

Historically, local entities have provided most of the homelessness assistance in their jurisdiction, relying in part on federal and state funding. As the homelessness crisis has become more acute, the state has taken a larger role in funding and supporting local governments\u2019 efforts to address homelessness. The state has increased its role in addressing homelessness by\u00a0providing significant, albeit one\u2011time and temporary, funding towards infrastructure and flexible aid to local governments in recent years. \nUpdate on Key Recent Homelessness State Spending. Recent budget actions reflect the increased role of the state in addressing homelessness. The state budget provided a total of $7.2\u00a0billion ($3.3\u00a0billion General Fund) in 2021\u201122 to about 30 homelessness\u2011related programs across various state departments. We provide implementation updates for several of the major, recent homelessness augmentations. \nHomelessness Package Proposes to Focuses on Near\u2011Team Needs. The Governor\u2019s 2022\u201123 budget proposes $2\u00a0billion one\u2011time General Fund over two years that is intended to address near\u2011term homelessness needs while previously authorized funds for long\u2011term housing solutions are implemented: $1.5 billion for behavioral health \u201cbridge\u201d housing and $500 million for the Encampment Resolution Grants\u00a0Program. \nDevote Attention to Overseeing Recent Augmentations. We suggest the Legislature dedicate the early part of the budget process to overseeing the implementation of last year\u2019s significant homelessness augmentations. Prior to authorizing increased funding for the activities proposed in the 2022\u201123 budget, ensuring that the homelessness efforts authorized in prior budgets are operating effectively, adequately supported, and can be maintained over time will be important. \nConsider Long\u2011Term Plan for Ongoing Homelessness Efforts. Addressing this crisis requires a complex combination of services and infrastructure. As more information about recent state efforts becomes available, we suggest the Legislature assess which types of interventions appear most effective. This information could help guide the state\u2019s long\u2011term fiscal and policy role in addressing homelessness. \nFor Any Authorized Funds, Set Clear Expectations and Establish Metrics to Assess Performance. Setting clear expectations through statute and establishing reporting requirements to facilitate oversight over the state\u2019s progress towards addressing homelessness will be critical. \n\nBackground",
