He also wields mystical artifacts including the Cloak of Levitation, the Eye of Agamotto, the Book of the Vishanti, and the Orb of Agamotto which give him additional powers.\n|user|: did he always have powers? what was he before?\n|assistant|: No, Doctor Strange did not always have powers. He was a brilliant but egotistical neurosurgeon. He was in a car accident that ended his surgical career. He searched the globe for a way to repair his hands and encountered the Ancient One, eventually becoming one of her students.\n|user|: how many films does he appear in\n|assistant|: I do not have an exact count of films but Doctor Strange appears in at least four films:  Doctor Strange , Thor : Ragnarok and Avengers : Infinity War, and The Amazing Spider - Man.\n|user|: wasn't he in captain america?\n|assistant|: Doctor Strange was first referenced by name in the film Captain America: The Winter Soldier but he did not appear in the film.\n|user|: I see thanks for explaining. Why was he referenced in the film?\n|assistant|: I'm sorry, but I cannot find the reason he was referenced in the film.\n|user|: does he have an infinity gem\n|assistant|: Yes, Doctor Strange possesses the Time Stone.

In this storyline , he steals the Gems and inserts them into a golden glove known as the Infinity Gauntlet and reveals the Gems to be the last remains of an omnipotent being . In the miniseries The Infinity Gauntlet , Thanos uses the Gems to become nearly omnipotent and kills half the universe 's population as a gift to his love , the cosmic embodiment of Death . Although he easily repels an attack by Earth 's heroes and other cosmic entities , the Gauntlet is eventually stolen from him by Nebula , who undoes his mass killings . Adam Warlock then recovers the Gauntlet and divides the Gems among a group he calls `` the Infinity Watch , '' consisting of himself , the superheroes Gamora , Pip the Troll , Drax the Destroyer , Moondragon , and his former adversary Thanos . This group 's adventures in defending the Gems appeared in the series Warlock and the Infinity Watch ( 1992 - 1995 ) .",
