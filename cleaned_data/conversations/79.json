Many more couples , however , experience involuntary childlessness for at least one year : estimates range from 12 % to 28 % .

Male fertility peaks usually at age 25 and declines after age 40 . The time needed to pass ( during which the couple tries to conceive ) for that couple to be diagnosed with infertility differs between different jurisdictions . Existing definitions of infertility lack uniformity , rendering comparisons in prevalence between countries or over time problematic . Therefore , data estimating the prevalence of infertility cited by various sources differs significantly . A couple that tries unsuccessfully to have a child after a certain period of time ( often a short period , but definitions vary ) is sometimes said to be subfertile , meaning less fertile than a typical couple . Both infertility and subfertility are defined as the inability to conceive after a certain period of time ( the length of which vary ) , so often the two terms overlap .",

In both men and women , ASA production are directed against surface antigens on sperm , which can interfere with sperm motility and transport through the female reproductive tract , inhibiting capacitation and acrosome reaction , impaired fertilization , influence on the implantation process , and impaired growth and development of the embryo . Factors contributing to the formation of antisperm antibodies in women are disturbance of normal immunoregulatory mechanisms , infection , violation of the integrity of the mucous membranes , accidental rape and unprotected oral or anal sex . Risk factors for the formation of antisperm antibodies in men include the breakdown of the blood \u2010 testis barrier , trauma and surgery , orchitis , varicocele , infections , prostatitis , testicular cancer , failure of immunosuppression and unprotected receptive anal or oral sex with men .",

However, whether it can be considered a \"good business\" is subjective and depends on various factors such as the regulatory environment, societal acceptance, and ethical considerations. It's also important to note that such programs aim to help individuals and couples struggling with infertility and should prioritize their well-being above any commercial interests."

Additionally , in most countries where it is legal and compensated , the law places a cap on the compensation and that cap tends to be in the vicinity of $1000 -- $2000 . In the US , no law caps the compensation , but the American Society for Reproductive Medicine ( ASRM ) requires member clinics to abide by ASRM standards , which provide that `` sums of $5,000 or more require justification and sums above $10,000 are not appropriate . '' The `` justification '' for payments over $5000 may include previous successful donations , unusually good family health history , or membership in minority ethnicities for which it is more difficult to find donors .",

The European Union limits any financial compensation for donors to at most $1500 . In some countries , most notably Spain and Cyprus , this has limited donors to the poorest segments of society . In the United States , donors are paid regardless of how many eggs she produces . A donor 's compensation may increase for each additional time she provides eggs , especially if the donor 's eggs have a history of reliably resulting in the recipient becoming pregnant . In the United States , egg - broker agencies are known for advertising to college students who are more likely to be in financial situations that motivate them to participate for the financial compensation . It is not unusual for one student to donate many times . Often , this is done without consideration of potential long - term health consequences . Such a student is arguably not making the decision to donate her eggs autonomously due to her unfavorable financial situation .",
