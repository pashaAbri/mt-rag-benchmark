Cached documents can be retrieved more quickly and more cheaply, but the tradeoff is that your application might be showing old data to your users for a time.\n\nIf you followed this tutorial, you must deprovision your resources to stop incurring charges. You can deprovision from the terraform directory on your terminal by typing the following command, terraform destroy --auto-approve.",

These JSON objects are called [documents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-documentsdocuments).\n\nAll documents must be contained in a database. For more information, see [partitioned databases](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-databasespartitioned-databases-database).\n\nThe [Grouping related documents together in IBM Cloudant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-grouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudantgrouping-related-documents-together-in-ibm-cloudant) guide provides an example of how documents for an e-commerce application might be used within an IBM Cloudant database.\n\n\n\n Partitioned databases \n\nIBM Cloudant supports two types of databases:\n\n\n\n* Partitioned\n* Nonpartitioned\n\n\n\nA partitioned database offers significant query performance and cost advantages but requires you to specify a logical partitioning of your data. The partitioning is specified as part of each document's ID. A partitioned database provides both global and partition queries. Partition queries target queries at a single, given document partition, meaning they need to process less data to return results. Therefore, partition queries offer significant performance advantages, and also often provide cost advantages over global queries. Global queries target the entire database, which leads to extra complexity, slower performance, and increased cost, but offers results that draw from all data.\n\nAlternatively, a nonpartitioned database might be created. This type of database can be less complex to work with since no partitioning scheme needs to be defined, but you can create only global secondary indexes.\n\nIBM Cloudant strongly encourages you to use a partitioned database for best long-term database performance where the data model allows for logical partitioning of documents.\n\nThe partitioning type of a database is set at database creation time. When you create a database, use the partitioned query string parameter to set whether the database is partitioned. The default for partitioned is false, maintaining compatibility with an earlier version.",

If you use the eventually consistent model, it's possible, under some conditions, to retrieve older document content. For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred.

For example, older content is retrieved when your application writes or updates a document that is followed immediately by a read of the same document.\n\nIn other words, your application would see the document content as it was before the write or update occurred.
