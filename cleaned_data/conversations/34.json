Originally , the winners kept it until a new champion was crowned . Currently , winning teams get the Stanley Cup during the summer and a limited number of days during the season . It is unusual among trophies to include winning members ' names . Every year since 1924 , a select portion of the winning players , coaches , management , and club staff names are engraved on its bands . However , there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players , so some names must be omitted . Initially a new band added each year , though this caused the trophy to grow in size , earning the nickname `` Stovepipe Cup '' . In 1958 the modern one - piece Cup was designed with a five - band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band . To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing , when the bottom band is full , the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame , and a new blank band added to the bottom . It has been referred to as The Cup , Lord Stanley 's Cup , The Holy Grail , or facetiously ( chiefly by sportswriters ) as Lord Stanley 's Mug . The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions , the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team .",

The game allows for the use of hands, and players can throw, catch, and run with the ball. Another key difference is that soccer is played in two 45-minute halves with a 15-minute break in between, while American Football is divided into four 15-minute quarters with a 12-minute break at halftime.\nIn summary, the main differences between soccer and American football are the way the ball is moved (with feet in soccer and hands in American football), the objective of the game (scoring goals in soccer and touchdowns in American football), and the duration of the game."

However it is interesting to note that some sports can take some player to eating disorder, like the Aesthetic sports ( dance , figure skating , gymnastics ). On the other hand, judo and wrestling are dependent of 35% of your body weight.  Eating disorders among individuals that participate in competitive activities , especially women , often lead to having physical and biological changes related to their weight that often mimic prepubescent stages . Oftentimes as women 's bodies change they lose their competitive edge which leads them to taking extreme measures to maintain their younger body shape . Men often struggle with binge eating followed by excessive exercise while focusing on building muscle rather than losing fat , but this goal of gaining muscle is just as much an eating disorder as obsessing over thinness. Overall,  several dietary factors play a very important role in maintaining skeletal health.",

Gymnastics , horse back riding , wrestling , body building , and dancing are just a few that fall into this category of weight dependent sports . Eating disorders among individuals that participate in competitive activities , especially women , often lead to having physical and biological changes related to their weight that often mimic prepubescent stages . Oftentimes as women 's bodies change they lose their competitive edge which leads them to taking extreme measures to maintain their younger body shape . Men often struggle with binge eating followed by excessive exercise while focusing on building muscle rather than losing fat , but this goal of gaining muscle is just as much an eating disorder as obsessing over thinness . The following statistics taken from Susan Nolen - Hoeksema 's book , ( ab ) normal psychology , shows the estimated percentage of athletes that struggle with eating disorders based on the category of sport .",
