You can create backup snapshots as frequently as 1 hour. However, the backup service does not provide continual backup with automatic failover, and restoring a volume from a backup or snapshot is a manual operation that takes time. If you require a higher level of service for automatic disaster recovery, see IBM's [Cloud disaster recovery solutions](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/disaster-recovery).\n\n\n\n\n\n What is restoring a volume from a snapshot? \n\nRestoring from a snapshot creates a new, fully provisioned boot or data volume. You can restore storage volumes during instance creation, instance modification, or when you provision a new stand-alone volume. For data volumes, you can also use the volumes API to create a data volume from a snapshot. For more information, see [Restoring a volume from a snapshot](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-restore).\n\nFor best performance, you can enable snapshots for fast restore. By using the fast restore feature, you can create a volume from a snapshot that is fully provisioned when the volume is created. For more information, see [Snapshots fast restore](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-aboutsnapshots_vpc_fast_restore).\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I add tags to a volume? \n\nYes, you can add user tags and access management tags to your volumes. User tags are used by the backup service to automatically create backup snapshots of the volume. Access management tags help organize access to your Block Storage for VPC volumes. For more information, see [Tags for Block Storage for VPC volumes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about&interface=uistorage-about-tags).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Performance questions",

You can restore boot and data volumes during instance creation or when you modify an existing instance. You can also restore a data volume from a snapshot of a volume that is not attached to an instance. Volumes can be restored from snapshots that were created manually or by a backup policy. You can restore volumes from fast restore clones and cross-regional copies of snapshots, too. You can create volumes from snapshots in the UI, from the CLI, with the API, or Terraform.\n\n\n\n About restoring a volume from a snapshot \n\nRestoring a volume from a snapshot creates a boot or data volume, depending on whether the snapshot is bootable or nonbootable.\n\n\n\n* Restoring from a bootable snapshot creates a boot volume that you can use to start a virtual server instance. The boot volume uses a general-purpose profile and is limited to 250 GB.\n* A new data volume that was created from nonbootable snapshot inherits its properties from the original volume, such as [profile](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-profiles), capacity, data, and metadata. If the source volume used [customer-managed encryption](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpc-encryption-aboutvpc-customer-managed-encryption), the volume inherits that encryption with the original customer root key (CRK). However, you can specify a larger volume size, different IOPS profile, and different CRK if you prefer.\n\n\n\nYou can restore volumes from a manually created snapshot or from a snapshot that was created by a backup policy. This type of snapshot is called a backup. For more information, see [Restoring a volume from a backup snapshot](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-baas-vpc-restore).",

As an example, when data is sent over a network that is secured using TLS, the data is encrypted using a TLS certificate. It is then sent over the network as crypto text, and then decrypted by the recipient. The encrypted text contains all the original data, and can be decrypted using a private key. However, hashing is a one-way function that uses data to create a unique string of numbers and letters. The hashed data cannot be converted back to the original form using the hash. To verify the data that created the hash, a recipient needs to create a new hash of the original data using the same hash function, and verify that the hash values match. A third party cannot use the hash without a copy of the original data.\n\nIt is important to be aware with this option that while Orgs A and B cannot see the actual ledger data because it is hashed, they are still able to see that Orgs C and D are transacting and can see the volume of transactions that are occurring between them.\n\nAlso, consider that data inside a private data collection can be purged from the peers that store it. While data is stored on a channel forever, collections allow members to specify how many blocks are committed to a channel before the [private data is purged](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-2.2/private_data_tutorial.htmlpd-purge). Once data is removed from the private data collection, the hash on the channel can no longer be used to verify the transaction that created it. In the example network in Figure 3, Org C and Org D can use a block to live policy to ensure that any data that does not need to persist forever is removed from the network entirely within a specified time period.\n\n\n\n\n\n Option two: Private data collections on a separate channel \n\nOrg C and Org D can also use private data collections in the context of a separate channel to provide additional isolation for their data.",

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated virtual network that combines the security of a private cloud with the availability and scalability of IBM's public cloud.\n\n\n\n Logical isolation \n\nVPC gives your applications logical isolation from other networks, while providing scalability and security. To make this logical isolation possible, the VPC is divided into subnets that use a range of private IP addresses. You can create subnets in suggested prefix ranges, or bring your own public IP address range (BYOIP) to your IBM Cloud account. By default, all resources within the same VPC can communicate with each other over the private network, regardless of their subnet.\n\n\n\n\n\n Quick instance provisioning with high network performance \n\nYou can quickly provision scalable compute resources in your VPC by creating virtual server instances with the core and RAM configuration that's best for your workload. You can select from the supported stock images or custom images that were imported from IBM Cloud Object Storage. All images are cloud-init enabled. You can connect to your instance without using a password by adding SSH keys.\n\nYou can create instances with up to 80 Gbps network bandwidth per instance. Each instance can be multi-homed, that is, you can create multiple network interfaces per instance.\n\n\n\n\n\n Multi-architecture images \n\nYou can choose to create virtual server instances with different operating systems on x86_64 or s390x processor architecture. For more information, see [Images](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images).\n\n\n\n\n\n Storage capabilities \n\nWhen you create an instance, a 100 GB block storage volume is automatically attached as a primary boot volume. To add secondary data volumes to your instance, create block storage volumes.\n\n\n\n\n\n External connectivity \n\nSeveral options are available for enabling your instances to communicate with the public internet:\n\n\n\n* To enable all instances in a subnet to send outgoing traffic, attach a public gateway to the subnet.\n* To enable communication to and from a particular instance, independent of whether the subnet is attached to a public gateway, associate the instance with a floating IP.",

This represents an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) within IBM Cloud that offers all of the benefits of isolated, secure, and flexible virtual cloud infrastructure from IBM. In comparison, the IBM Cloud classic infrastructure virtual servers offering uses virtual instances with native and VLAN networking to communicate to each other within a data center; however, the instances are restricted in one well-working pod by using subnet and VLAN networking as a gap scale up of virtual resources should rely between the pods. What\u2019s new with IBM Cloud VPC is a network orchestrator layer concept that eliminates the pod boundaries and restrictions, so this new concept handles all the networking for every virtual instance running within VPC across regions and zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Highly available system for SAP NetWeaver on IBM Cloud VPC \n\nIn a highly available (HA) system, every instance can run on a separate IBM Cloud virtual server instance. The cluster HA configuration for the SAP application server consists of two virtual server instances, each of them located in the same zone within the region by using placement groups. Placement groups assure that both cluster resources and cloud resources are also located in different compute nodes as specified in the following placement groups section.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure 1.",
