Make a note of the warning message that are displayed when you try to upload the JSON file.\n2. Edit the skill to address the issues.\n\n\n\n* If you have access to a public service instance, open the skill from there and make edits. Export the edited skill by downloading it.\n* Otherwise, open the JSON file in a text editor and make edits.\n\n\n\nYou might need to remove the @sys-person and @sys-location entities from your training data, and any references to them from dialog nodes, for example.\n3. Try again to import the edited skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding the skill to an assistant \n\nYou can add one skill to an assistant.

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.",

If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages",

You can choose to use the legacy version of the system entities API by switching to it from the Options>System Entities page. This settings page is not displayed in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills because use of the legacy version of the API is no longer supported for those languages.

We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously).

You can choose to use the legacy version of the system entities API by switching to it from the Options>System Entities page. This settings page is not displayed in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills because use of the legacy version of the API is no longer supported for those languages. For more information about the new system entities, see [System entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities).\n\n\n\n\n\n 28 October 2020 \n\nIntroducing the actions skill!\n: The actions skill is the latest step in the continuing evolution of Watson Assistant as a software as a service application. The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nThe actions skill is available as a beta feature. For more information, see [Adding an actions skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-actions-add).\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance. For more information, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\nText messaging integration was renamed\n: The Twilio messaging integration was renamed to SMS with Twilio.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9 October 2020 \n\nSearch skill update",

It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. Add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.

If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages \n\nFor bidirectional languages, such as Arabic, you can change your skill preferences.\n\n\n\n1. From your skill tile, click the Actions drop-down menu, and then select Language Preferences.\n\nThis option is only available for skills that are configured to use a bidirectional language.\n2.

Languages supported include English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages.\n|user|: What are the other skills and what languages are supported for them?\n|assistant|:  1. **Actions Skill**: Actions offer step-by-step flows for a conversation and can be built by anyone. \n2. **Search Skill**: This skill is configured to search appropriate external data sources for answers to customer questions. \nThe language support for this skill is not explicitly mentioned, but since it's a part of the Watson Assistant service, it should support the same languages as the dialog skill.\n|user|: how many skills can I create?\n|assistant|: The number of skills you can create depends on your Watson Assistant plan type. Any sample dialog skills that are available for you to use do not count toward your limit unless you use them. A skill version does not count as a skill: - Enterprise: 100 - Premium (legacy): 100 - Plus: 50 - Standard (legacy): 20 - Lite, Trial: 5 Additionally, after 30 days of inactivity, an unused skill in a Lite plan service instance might be deleted to free up space.\n|user|: What about Hebrew?\n|assistant|: Hebrew is not listed among the supported languages for building dialog skills in Watson Assistant. The supported languages include English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. However,  you can use the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available.\n|user|: Can it handle the reverse order of text?\n|assistant|: Yes, the universal language model can handle the reverse order of text if the skill supports a language with right-to-left directional text, such as Hebrew.

It is by adding training data that is written in the target language that the universal model is constructed. Add intents, intent user examples, and entities. The universal language model adapts to understand and support your language of choice.\n\n\n\n\n\n Integration considerations \n\nWhen your skill is ready, you can add it to an assistant and deploy it. Keep these tips in mind:\n\n\n\n* Search skill: If you build an assistant that specializes in a single language, be sure to connect it to data collections that are written in that language. For more information about the languages that are supported by Discovery, see [Language support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-language-support).\n* Web chat: Web chat has some hardcoded strings that you can customize to reflect your target language.
