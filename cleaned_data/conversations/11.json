          "text": "Oral Argument - California Appellate Courts\nWhat does my lawyer do in oral argument? If you have a lawyer, then the lawyer will present your oral argument. You can go to court for oral argument but you are not required to go if you are represented by a lawyer.\n \n Can I get a transcript of what was said in the oral argument for my case? All oral arguments in the Court of Appeal are electronically recorded. Any party may pay a fee to get a copy of the oral argument recording from the Court of Appeal. If you want a written transcript of the recording, you will need to contact a transcription service and pay them a separate fee.\n \n What does the court think if I do not make an oral argument? If you decide not to make an oral argument, the court will not think that you are not interested or that you don\u2019t care about the appeal. You do not give up or weaken any arguments in your brief. The court will not think differently or badly about you or your arguments. If you do not make an oral argument, it will not negatively impact the way the court decides an appeal.\n \n How will the court decide if there are no oral arguments? If all the parties waive oral argument \u2013 meaning no parties talk to the justices in person \u2013 then the Court of Appeal will decide your appeal based on the briefs, the law, and the record on appeal.\n \n What does it mean if the court sends me a notice saying they don\u2019t need oral argument? Sometimes the Court of Appeal will send notice to the parties saying the court is prepared to issue a decision without oral argument. This is not a sign that the court will decide either for or against the appeal.\nEven though the court says oral argument is not necessary, you can still request oral argument. You would need to give the court notice in writing and tell them you want to make an oral argument. As long as you meet the deadline in the court\u2019s notice about oral argument, the court will almost always schedule time for your oral argument.\n \n Where can I get legal help? Form APP-001 has full instructions on appeal procedures.\nEach Court of Appeal has self-help resources online. You can also contact your local Court of Appeal to see if they have a self-help center at the court.",

The legal fees will be subtracted from the retainer. If the retainer starts to run out, you may need to add more money.\n\nContingency fee\nYou pay the lawyer from the money you receive if you win the case or settle it out of court. If you lose, the lawyer does not receive a fee.\n\nStatutory fee\nThe cost is set by law\n\nThe lawyer will also charge you for the costs of your case (filing fees, copying expenses, expert fees). You will be responsible for paying these costs even if your case is not successful. Costs can add up quickly. It is a good idea to ask the lawyer for a written estimate of what the costs will be.\n\n Handling problems with a lawyer\n\n If you have questions or concerns about your case, first talk to your lawyer.\u00a0If you are having serious problems with your lawyer and have been unable to resolve them, there are other things you can do.\nThe State Bar also has a lot of information about what to do if you are having problems with your lawyer.\n\n \n\nWas this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\ndid this information help you with your case?\n\nGreat!",

For example, to see if the trial court judge applied the wrong law to the facts of the case.\nThe appellate court cannot change the trial court's decision just because the appellate court judges (called justices in the Court of Appeal) disagree with it\nThe trial court is entitled to hear the evidence and come to its own decision. The appellate court can only reverse the trial court's decision if it finds a legal mistake in the trial court proceedings that was so important that it changed at least part of the outcome of the case. Because of this heavy burden on the appellant to prove this type of mistake, it is quite difficult to win an appeal.\nFiling an appeal does not stop the trial court's order\nUnless you ask the trial or appellate court to postpone (\"stay\") the trial court's order, you must do what the trial court's order requires you to do during the appeal. A request for a stay can be complicated, and you may still have to pay some of the money ordered by the trial court upfront. Ask a lawyer if one of these options would be good in your case and get help. But remember that an appeal is not a way to put off having to comply with the trial court's order.\n\nOverview of civil appeals\n\nIf you're considering an appeal, read through each section to get an idea of your options and what you'll have to do if you do decide to appeal. Appeals are very complicated, so also talk to a lawyer.\u00a0\n\nAppellate court basics",

Most appeals are limited to a review of the record from the lower court. Parties cannot introduce new \r\n evidence, but are limited to what was said and introduced at the original trial. The appellate court reviews the lower court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application of the law to the facts as presented \r\n at the trial.\nSome appeals do allow for a new trial without reference to the evidence submitted in the original proceeding. Such an appeal results in a trial de novo, meaning a trial \r\n from the beginning. Appeals from small claims court result in a trial de novo in the Superior court. The superior court judge is not bound by the decision of the small claims \r\n judge, and new evidence can be presented.\n\nInformation on Appeal Types\n\nSmall Claims Appeals\n\nAppeal after being present at trial\nIn small claims court an appeal results in a trial de novo, meaning a trial from the beginning, conducted in the Superior Court. Therefore, all evidence presented at the \r\n small claims trial must be presented again in the Superior Court at the trial de novo. Only a Superior Court judge will hear a trial de novo; no pro tem or temporary judge \r\n hears small claims appeals.\r\n\r\n Only the defendant, or a plaintiff who was counter sued as a cross-defendant and lost on the cross-complaint, can appeal a small claims case. A plaintiff cannot file an \r\n appeal. The defendant or cross-defendant must have been present at the time of trial in order to appeal the decision.\nAny of the parties may choose to have an attorney represent him, her or it at the trial de novo. Unlike in regular superior court cases, an attorney is not required to \r\n represent a corporation at a trial de novo.",

However, generally, appeals are made when a party believes that legal errors were made during the trial or hearing process that affected the outcome of the case. These errors could include improper admission or exclusion of evidence, incorrect jury instructions, or legal decisions made by the judge. In order to lodge an appeal, a notice of appeal must be filed within the required time frame, and a written brief outlining the grounds for the appeal must be submitted to the appellate court. The appellate court will then review the record of the lower court proceedings and the arguments presented in the brief to determine whether any legal errors occurred and whether those errors warrant reversing the decision of the lower court."

Here are the general steps involved in a child support case:\n1. File a petition: To start a child support case, you need to file a petition with your local court. This petition will outline your request for child support and provide relevant information about you, the other parent, and the child.\n2. Serve the petition: Once you've filed the petition, you must serve it to the other parent, informing them of the case and giving them an opportunity to respond. The other parent will have a certain amount of time to respond to the petition.\n3. Attend a hearing: After the petition and response have been filed, a hearing will be scheduled. During this hearing, a judge will consider the evidence presented by both parties and make a decision regarding child support.\n4. Establish a child support order: Based on the evidence presented, the judge will establish a child support order. This order will outline the amount of child support to be paid, how often payments should be made, and when the payments should begin.\n5. Enforce the child support order: If the paying parent fails to make the required child support payments, the receiving parent can request enforcement of the child support order. This may involve wage garnishment, bank account seizure, or other measures to ensure payment.\n6. Modify the child support order: If there is a significant change in circumstances, either parent can request a modification of the child support order. This might include changes in income, living arrangements, or the needs of the child.\nFor legal advice and representation in your child support case, consider consulting with a family law attorney who is familiar with California laws and procedures.\nRegarding your question about legal research for your oral argument, you can visit the law library to conduct research and consult self-help guides. The Form APP-001 provides comprehensive instructions on appeal procedures, and each Court of Appeal offers self-help resources online. You can also inquire with your local Court of Appeal to check if they have a self-help center at the court."

This is known as contempt of court. However, the court may consider other options before resorting to incarceration, such as wage garnishment, bank seizures, or driver's license suspension. It's important to note that the court's primary concern is the welfare of the child, and its decisions will reflect that. If you are having trouble paying child support, it is recommended that you seek legal assistance to explore your options and avoid potential penalties."

The purpose of spousal support is to help the supported spouse maintain a similar standard of living as during the marriage. The amount and duration of spousal support are determined based on various factors, such as the length of the marriage, the income and earning capacity of both spouses, and the standard of living established during the marriage. If you have specific questions about spousal support in your case, it may be helpful to consult with a family law attorney."
