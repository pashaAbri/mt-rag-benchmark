Before their salary negotiations for the third season , the cast decided to enter collective negotiations , despite Warner Bros . ' preference for individual deals . The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member , meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced .

The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations . At the time , that financial benefit of a piece of the show 's lucrative back - end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show , like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby .",

One of few sitcoms at the time to be neither a workplace comedy , family sitcom or star a famous comedian , Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York Times explained that each of the show 's main characters are `` of equal importance . '' As a writer , Crane preferred it this way because `` utilizing six equal players , rather than emphasizing one or two , would allow for myriad story lines . '' Kauffman echoed `` that Friends worked best when the entire ensemble was onstage . '' The only reason Aniston is credited first during the show 's title sequence is because the cast is listed alphabetically . The show 's ensemble format is also believed to have prevented jealous conflicts among the cast . Famously , the Friends cast became the first in television history to negotiate as a group for equal salaries , refusing to work until their demands of $100,000 per episode were met during season three , which eventually increased to $1 million per episode by seasons nine and ten -- approximately $25 million per year . Alongside Cox and actress Lisa Kudrow , who portrays Phoebe , Aniston became the highest - paid television actress of all time . By then , Aniston had surpassed Cox as the show 's most famous cast member due to having launched an international hair trend with the `` Rachel '' and successfully transitioning into a film career , combined with her high - profile relationship with her then - husband , actor Brad Pitt , who had once guest starred in an episode of the show . At times the producers would use the actress ' popularity to boost the show 's ratings , notably her character 's seventh season kiss with actress Winona Ryder and pregnancy arc . Aniston had been telling the press that the show 's ninth season would be her last , and was initially hesitant to return to Friends to film its tenth and final season . She explained to NBC 's Matt Lauer , `` I wanted it to end when people still loved us and we were on a high . And then I was also feeling like , ' How much more of Rachel do I have in me ? ' '' However , the actress ultimately agreed to complete the tenth season of Friends , which was reduced from 24 to 18 episodes to accommodate Aniston 's busy film schedule .",

At the beginning of the second season , production moved to the larger Stage 24 , which was renamed `` The Friends Stage '' after the series finale . Filming for the series began during the summer ( June , July , and August in the US ) of 1994 in front of a live audience , who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters ; a hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes . Each 22 - minute episode took six hours to film -- twice the length of most sitcom tapings -- mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script .",
