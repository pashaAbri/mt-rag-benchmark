Conversely, you may feel comfortable enough to review a high-level summary sheet with a founder, or to find some other way of tactfully reviewing the right information. In any case, I would keep the request vague, simple, and direct, and see what information they show you. If your request is too specific, then you risk pushing them to show information A, which they refuse to do, but a vague request would've prompted them to show you information B. A too-specific request might get you information X when a vague request could have garnered XYZ. Vague requests are also less aggressive and may raise fewer objections. The third question is difficult to say. My personal understanding is some perspective of how venture capitalists look at the investment opportunity (you didn't say how new this startup is or what series/stage they are on, so I'll try to stay vague). The actual financials are less relevant for startups than they are for other investments because the situation will definitely change. Most venture capital firms like to look at the burn rate or amount of cash spent, usually at a monthly rate. A high burn rate relative to infusions of cash suggests the company is growing rapidly but may have a risk of toppling (i.e. failing before exit). Burn rate can change drastically during the early life of the startup. Of course burn rate needs the context of revenues and reserves (and latest valuation is helpful as a benchmark, but you may be able to calculate that from the restricted share offer made to you). High burn rate might not be bad, if the company is booming along towards a successful exit. You might also want to look at some sort of business plan or info sheet, rather than financials alone. You want to gauge the size of the market (most startups like to claim 9- or 10-figure markets, so even a few percentage points of market share will hit revenue into the 8-figures).",

Obviously a startup has no prior income to use, so it must either raise money through equity or debt. People say that one must borrow contingent on their salary. Banks lend money based on the ability to pay the loan back plus interest. For individuals, their income is their primary source of cash flow, so, yes, it is usually the determining factor in getting a loan. For a business the key factor is future cash flows. So a business will borrow money, say, to buy a new asset (like a factory) that will be used to generate cash flows in the future so that they can pay down the debt. If the bank believes that the use of the money is going to be profitable enough that they will get their money back with interest, they'll loan the money. Equity investors are essentially the same, but since they don't get a guaranteed payback (they only get paid through non-guaranteed dividends or liquidation), their risk is higher and they are looking for higher expected returns. So the question I'd have as a bank or equity investor is \"\"what are you going to do with the money?\"\" What is your business strategy? What are you going to do that will make profits in the future? Do you have a special idea or skill that you can turn into a profitable business? (Crowdfunding would be similar - people are willing to give you money based on either the social or personal benefit of some product or service.) So any business either starts small and grows over time (which is how the vast majority of businesses grow), or has some special idea, asset, skill, or something that would make a bank willing to take a risk on a huge loan. I know, again, that people here tend to turn blind eyes on unfortunate realities, but people do make giant businesses without having giant incomes. The \"\"unfortunate reality\"\" is that most startups fail. Which may sound bad, but also keep in mind that most startups are created by people that are OK with failing.",

I can tell from your post that you think like an investor.  It is highly unlikely that the entrepreneurial programmers that you will be backing will be wired that way.   From the modest amount that you are investing, you are unlikely to be the lead investor in this opportunity.  If you are interested in proceeding, simply stick along for the ride, examining the terms and documents that more significant investors will be demanding.  Remain positive and supportive, but simply wait to sign on the dotted line until others have done the heavy lifting.

          "text": "\nTurukawa's answer is quite good, and for your own specific situation, you might begin by being sceptical about what you are getting for investing a few thousand dollars.  With the exception of Paul Graham's Y-Combinator, there are very few opportunities to invest at that type of level, and Y-Combinator provides a lot of other assistance besides their modest initial investment.   I can tell from your post that you think like an investor.  It is highly unlikely that the entrepreneurial programmers that you will be backing will be wired that way.   From the modest amount that you are investing, you are unlikely to be the lead investor in this opportunity.  If you are interested in proceeding, simply stick along for the ride, examining the terms and documents that more significant investors will be demanding.  Remain positive and supportive, but simply wait to sign on the dotted line until others have done the heavy lifting. For more insights into startups themselves, see Paul Graham's essays at www.paulgraham.com.  He's the real deal, and his recent essays will provide you with current insights about software startups. Good luck.",

There is a huge opportunity to learn from them, which is a lot harder when you're the lone expert at a 5-person company (you rely on whatever you can scrape up from the internet, etc.). Most people learn faster with good mentoring.  - there is money to spend on things that you need. No raised eyebrows from the CEO when you say that you need a $20 lamp for your desk, or even more serious issues like adequate hardware for what you need to do, getting tools you need, etc. (Less of an issue at a VC-funded startup, until the money starts running low.)  - there are entire teams that help with things like documentation, customer support, sales, tools, and other things, which frees me up to do what I'm good at, which is making software.  I remember reading some advice a while ago that still rings true to me, which is that there isn't a single \"\"right\"\" place to work (small/large, etc.); the right thing to do is get experience with a variety of different environments - in the end you'll be stronger for it.\"",

Conversely, you may feel comfortable enough to review a high-level summary sheet with a founder, or to find some other way of tactfully reviewing the right information. In any case, I would keep the request vague, simple, and direct, and see what information they show you. If your request is too specific, then you risk pushing them to show information A, which they refuse to do, but a vague request would've prompted them to show you information B. A too-specific request might get you information X when a vague request could have garnered XYZ. Vague requests are also less aggressive and may raise fewer objections. The third question is difficult to say. My personal understanding is some perspective of how venture capitalists look at the investment opportunity (you didn't say how new this startup is or what series/stage they are on, so I'll try to stay vague). The actual financials are less relevant for startups than they are for other investments because the situation will definitely change. Most venture capital firms like to look at the burn rate or amount of cash spent, usually at a monthly rate. A high burn rate relative to infusions of cash suggests the company is growing rapidly but may have a risk of toppling (i.e. failing before exit). Burn rate can change drastically during the early life of the startup. Of course burn rate needs the context of revenues and reserves (and latest valuation is helpful as a benchmark, but you may be able to calculate that from the restricted share offer made to you). High burn rate might not be bad, if the company is booming along towards a successful exit. You might also want to look at some sort of business plan or info sheet, rather than financials alone. You want to gauge the size of the market (most startups like to claim 9- or 10-figure markets, so even a few percentage points of market share will hit revenue into the 8-figures).",

          "text": "\n\"There are three (or four) ways that a company can grow: (Crowdfunding is a relatively new (in mainstream businesses) alternative financing method where people will finance a company with the expectation that they will benefit from the product or service that they provide.) Obviously a startup has no prior income to use, so it must either raise money through equity or debt. People say that one must borrow contingent on their salary. Banks lend money based on the ability to pay the loan back plus interest. For individuals, their income is their primary source of cash flow, so, yes, it is usually the determining factor in getting a loan. For a business the key factor is future cash flows. So a business will borrow money, say, to buy a new asset (like a factory) that will be used to generate cash flows in the future so that they can pay down the debt. If the bank believes that the use of the money is going to be profitable enough that they will get their money back with interest, they'll loan the money. Equity investors are essentially the same, but since they don't get a guaranteed payback (they only get paid through non-guaranteed dividends or liquidation), their risk is higher and they are looking for higher expected returns. So the question I'd have as a bank or equity investor is \"\"what are you going to do with the money?\"\" What is your business strategy? What are you going to do that will make profits in the future? Do you have a special idea or skill that you can turn into a profitable business? (Crowdfunding would be similar - people are willing to give you money based on either the social or personal benefit of some product or service.) So any business either starts small and grows over time (which is how the vast majority of businesses grow), or has some special idea, asset, skill, or something that would make a bank willing to take a risk on a huge loan. I know, again, that people here tend to turn blind eyes on unfortunate realities, but people do make giant businesses without having giant incomes. The \"\"unfortunate reality\"\" is that most startups fail. Which may sound bad, but also keep in mind that most startups are created by people that are OK with failing.",

It is impossible to say ALL of anything is a certain way. I'm not suggesting that at all. I'm going to specifically talk about averages. It seems like you've never been around the average.  The average minimum wage employee doesn't have a high school education. It is fairly safe to say that they continuously are not developing skills that provide value both to themselves and others. If a person refuses to provide more for society, should society fill the gap?  You suggest that people who are poor didn't get there because of their own right. Are people who are self-made millionaires (on average) good with finances? Why would that be? If yes, why do you assume those that are successful are so because of their own merit but cannot be blamed for failure?  Seattle is a nice place. My exterior painter is doing a job there right now. It's a 3 month job. He is painting 1,000 apartments. He took 7 guys with him that he pays around $1,750 a week plus room and board. He had to take 7 guys with him because he can't find workers up in Washington. Can you imagine that? People in Seattle have not developed the skill of exterior painting. That's the reality of your job market. Even further, companies do have massive incentives to move to cheaper locations. The starting salary of large corporations varies wildly based on cost of living. Goldman Sachs will offer nearly $100k a year starting to work in the NYC branch compared to $65-70k in Houston.",

If willing to start near bottom, go to your business school and start applying to bank associate programs.  Sounds like you would like sales and trading more than M&amp;A, so focus there. 2.   If you got in at associate level, you would do 1-3 months of training and then get assigned a desk.  Finance going through a tough time right now, so trajectory isn't what it used to be.  Expect to be a VP after 2-4 years, then its all dependent on luck and skill. 3.   If you land a job at a top 15 bank, you should be making total comp of 150k or more after the first year.  Salaries not quite at 150k, but most VPS make over 150k salary, not to mention bigger bonus's.  4.   If you did M&amp;A you would be working very serious hours.  If you go into Sales and Trading your hours will be anywhere from 40 to 60 hours a week depending on the desk.  Trading hours tend to be the shortest. 5.  Boston isn't a hot bed for i-banking finance.  NYC, London, Sing, Hong Kong tend to be the places to be.  I know nobody in Boston that could help.",

The average minimum wage employee doesn't have a high school education. It is fairly safe to say that they continuously are not developing skills that provide value both to themselves and others. If a person refuses to provide more for society, should society fill the gap?  You suggest that people who are poor didn't get there because of their own right. Are people who are self-made millionaires (on average) good with finances? Why would that be? If yes, why do you assume those that are successful are so because of their own merit but cannot be blamed for failure?  Seattle is a nice place. My exterior painter is doing a job there right now. It's a 3 month job. He is painting 1,000 apartments. He took 7 guys with him that he pays around $1,750 a week plus room and board. He had to take 7 guys with him because he can't find workers up in Washington. Can you imagine that? People in Seattle have not developed the skill of exterior painting. That's the reality of your job market. Even further, companies do have massive incentives to move to cheaper locations. The starting salary of large corporations varies wildly based on cost of living. Goldman Sachs will offer nearly $100k a year starting to work in the NYC branch compared to $65-70k in Houston.",

That figure must be several years old - $86k base pay sounds about the range they were paying in 2006 or so. About a year ago Microsoft handed out massive across-the-board pay raises to everyone to bring their salaries in line with those offered by Apple and Google. But obviously like all companies they keep the exact figures hidden from public.  About two years ago I knew some college graduates going to work for Microsoft, and they were already in the $90k range even before the sweeping pay raises which happened mid last year.  And this is all of course all referring to base pay and doesn't count bonuses. Because of the way Microsoft's review process works, almost everyone receives a bonus at the end of the year. 90% of engineers at MS will receive as a bonus 10-20% of their annual salary in cash, and an additional 10-20% of their annual salary in stock.  Now people don't usually count those when comparing base pay, but if you want to look at total compensation it's *easily* past six figures even if you assume a really low base pay like $86k.",
