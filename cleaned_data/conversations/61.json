They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing. It may take up to 3 days to receive results.\nAntigen Tests\nAntigen tests* are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15-30 minutes. Positive results are accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than PCR tests, especially when symptoms are not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection. To be confident you do not have COVID-19, FDA recommends 2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. A single PCR test can be used to confirm an antigen test result.\n\n*Self-tests, or at-home tests, are antigen tests that can be taken anywhere without having to go to a specific testing site. Read self-test package inserts thoroughly and follow the instructions closely when performing the test.\nTop of PageChoosing a COVID-19 Test\nI want to get tested and:\nI have not had COVID-19 or I have not had a positive test within the past 90 days.You may choose a PCR or antigen test.\nIf you use an antigen test and your result is negative, repeat testing following FDA recommendations.\nI tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days.My first positive test result was within:30 days or less\n\nI have symptoms\nUse an antigen test.

However, the document also notes that antigen tests may be less likely to detect the virus than PCR tests, especially when symptoms are not present.\nIn the context of the Senator Scott Wiener's document, testing results generally take two to 12 days, as it takes time to ship the samples and for labs to process the tests. However, some facilities with their own labs or nearby facilities may provide results in as little as 24 hours.\nIt is recommended to consult with your healthcare provider for more specifics regarding the testing location you chose."

In humans there are several known coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections. These coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19.\nTop of PageCoronavirus Disease 2019:\nEmergence\nCOVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market; however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases occurred.\nTransmission\nThere are three main ways that COVID-19 can spread:\n\nBy breathing in air carrying droplets or aerosol particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus when close to an infected person or in poorly ventilated spaces with infected persons\nBy having droplets and particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth \u2013 especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze\nBy touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles on them\n\nThe droplets that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is recommended by the WHO to avoid infection,1 whereas CDC recommends maintaining a physical distance of at least 1.8 meters (6ft) between persons.",

Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is recommended by the WHO to avoid infection,1 whereas CDC recommends maintaining a physical distance of at least 1.8 meters (6ft) between persons. Respiratory droplets can land on hands, objects, or surfaces around the person when they cough or talk, and people can then become infected with COVID-19 from touching hands, objects or surfaces with droplets and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Additionally, transmission can occur from those with mild symptoms or from those who do not feel ill.\nThere are certain circumstances that can increase the risk of infection for COVID-19 such as poorly ventilated space. In indoor spaces with poor ventilation, the concentration of virus particles is often higher than outdoors.2,3 Other factors that are associated with increased COVID-19 risk include prolonged exposure to those infected with COVID-19, close contact with infected persons, and any other activity that leads to exposure to a greater amount of respiratory droplets and particles.\nSymptoms\nA wide range of symptoms for COVID-19 have been reported.4 These symptoms include:\n\nFever or chills\nCough\nMuscle or body aches\nAnorexia\nSore throat\nNasal congestion or runny nose\nHeadache\nDiarrhea\nNausea\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nLoss of smell or taste\n\nThe estimated incubation period is between 2 and 14 days with a median of 5 days. It is important to note that some people become infected and do not develop any symptoms or feel ill.\nPeople at Higher Risk for Severe Illness\nCOVID-19 is a relatively new disease; therefore, additional risk factors for severe COVID-19 may continue to be identified. In some cases, people who get COVID-19 can develop severe complications, including difficulty breathing, causing a need for hospitalization and intensive care. 5 These severe complications often lead to death.",

And the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was working on creating a coronavirus vaccine even before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThey got the funding they needed to work quickly.\u00a0The COVID-19 pandemic was a public health emergency. So the U.S. government invested millions of dollars to help study and test vaccines.\nThey used a faster review process with all the same steps.\u00a0The FDA authorized the original COVID-19 vaccines under their Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). An EUA follows the same steps that full-term clinical trials take. This includes testing each vaccine on thousands of human participants. The only difference is that an EUA speeds up the FDA\u2019s review process. This helps get critical vaccines to people faster while still making sure the vaccines are safe and that they work well.\nThey involved many experts in reviewing data.\u00a0Independent groups also reviewed trial results to make sure the vaccines are safe. These include groups like the National Medical Association, the leading professional society of Black doctors.\n\nThe FDA continues to monitor COVID-19 vaccines even after they\u2019re approved.\nPlay this FDA video to learn more about the EUA process (YouTube)\n\n It\u2019s safe to get several vaccines in the same year \n \n\nVaccines have pieces of germs or viruses, killed germs, or weakened germs in them.\nThe goal of a vaccine is to teach your immune system to make antibodies to fight off the real virus if you\u2019re exposed to it.

COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for people with underlying health problems like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity. People with these conditions are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. Please consult with your health care provider if you have specific questions about the COVID vaccine and your health.\u00a0If I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated?\u00a0Yes. CDC recommends that you get vaccinated even if you have already had COVID-19, because you can catch it more than once. While you may have some short-term antibody protection after recovering from COVID-19, we don\u2019t know how long this protection will last.\u00a0Will the vaccine make me sick or will I have side effects?You may not notice any changes in how you feel after getting the shot. But it\u2019s also possible to feel a little \u201cunder the weather.\u201d This can happen after\u00a0any\u00a0vaccine. It is the body\u2019s immune response to getting vaccinated and a sign that the vaccine is starting to work.After the COVID-19 vaccine, you may have:A sore arm where you got the shotA headacheChillsFeverTirednessOver the counter pain relievers and fever reducers may help.You should feel better in a day or two. If you still don't feel well after two or three days, talk to your health care provider.Do COVID-19 vaccines work against variants\u00a0of the virus?\u00a0All COVID-19 vaccines authorized or approved for emergency use in the United States have proven extremely effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. The effectiveness of the FDA-approved and -authorized vaccines remains strong even against newer strains, including against\u00a0variants.Those who are unvaccinated have the greatest risk of becoming seriously ill, which is why the New York State Department of Health urges all eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated as soon as they are able.\u00a0Can I get an allergic reaction from the COVID-19 vaccine?People can have allergic reactions to any medication or biological product such as a vaccine.",

The vaccines have been proven to help protect against COVID-19 and reduce the risk of severe illness and death.\nLike any vaccine or medication, COVID-19 vaccines can cause side effects, although most are mild and short-lived. Common side effects include a sore arm where the shot was given, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, and nausea. These side effects usually go away on their own within a few days. Serious side effects are rare, but if you experience any symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the face and throat, or a fast heartbeat, seek medical attention immediately.\nIt is important to note that the benefits of getting vaccinated far outweigh the risks of experiencing side effects or developing severe illness from COVID-19. I encourage you to speak with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about the vaccine or if you would like more information."
