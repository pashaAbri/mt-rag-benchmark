Europa Clipper aims to help answer questions about the ocean that scientists strongly believe lies below Europa\u2019s icy crust.\n\nLearn More\n\nAssembly\n\nInstruments\n\nMeet Europa Clipper\n\nThe spacecraft will fly by the moon about 50 times while orbiting Jupiter. (It can\u2019t orbit Europa because doing so would bring Europa Clipper too close to the gas giant\u2019s brutal radiation belts. Learn more in the video.) On each flyby, a suite of science instruments will gather data on how deep the subsurface ocean is, how thick the ice crust is, and, potentially, the characteristics of any plumes that may be venting subsurface water into space. The goal is to find out whether Europa has the potential to support life.\nThe series\u2019 premiere episode features Europa Clipper Project Manager Jordan Evans, who also has worked on NASA\u2019s Curiosity Mars rover and the agency\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope. In the video, he joins Deputy Science Manager Trina Ray, who worked on NASA\u2019s Cassini and Galileo missions. They venture into JPL\u2019s storied High Bay 1 clean room, where the Europa Clipper spacecraft is under construction \u2013 and where all of NASA\u2019s Mars rovers, the twin Voyager spacecraft, and other historic spacecraft were assembled.\nWhile you\u2019re digging into the nuts and bolts of the spacecraft, check out a 24-hour live feed of assembly in progress in High Bay 1.\nAdditional episodes of \u201cSpacecraft Makers\u201d will include more activity inside other clean rooms where components of Europa Clipper are coming together. Future seasons of the series will cover other missions under construction at JPL.\nMore About the Mission\nEuropa Clipper\u2019s main science goal is to determine whether there are places below the surface of Jupiter\u2019s icy moon, Europa, that could support life. The mission\u2019s three main science objectives are to understand the nature of the ice shell and the ocean beneath it, along with the moon\u2019s composition and geology.",

The surface also shows signs of past and present geological activity, such as ridges, chaos terrain, and lenticulae. These features suggest that there is heat being generated from within Europa, which is thought to be due to tidal heating caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. Additionally, the surface of Europa is subject to bombardment by radiation from Jupiter, which can cause the ice to darken and form a reddish-brown color in some areas. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists call \"chaos terrain.\"",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nJupiter\u2019s moon Europa and its global ocean may currently have conditions suitable for life. Scientists are studying processes on the icy surface as they prepare to explore.\nIt\u2019s easy to see the impact of space debris on our Moon, where the ancient, battered surface is covered with craters and scars. Jupiter\u2019s icy moon Europa withstands a similar trouncing \u2013 along with a punch of super-intense radiation. As the uppermost surface of the icy moon churns, material brought to the surface is zapped by high-energy electron radiation accelerated by Jupiter.\nNASA-funded scientists are studying the cumulative effects of small impacts on Europa\u2019s surface as they prepare to explore the distant moon with the Europa Clipper mission and study the possibilities for a future lander mission. Europa is of particular scientific interest because its salty ocean, which lies beneath a thick layer of ice, may currently have conditions suitable for existing life. That water may even make its way into the icy crust and onto the moon\u2019s surface.\nNew research and modeling estimate how far down that surface is disturbed by the process called \u201cimpact gardening.\u201d The work, published July 12 in Nature Astronomy, estimates that the surface of Europa has been churned by small impacts to an average depth of about 12 inches (30 centimeters) over tens of millions of years. And any molecules that might qualify as potential biosignatures, which include chemical signs of life, could be affected at that depth.\nThat\u2019s because the impacts would churn some material to the surface, where radiation would likely break the bonds of any potential large, delicate molecules generated by biology.",

The mission's three main science objectives are to understand the nature of the ice shell and the ocean beneath it, to investigate its composition, and to characterize its geology.

It is covered in a thick crust of frozen water that is estimated to be between 10 to 100 kilometers thick. The surface also shows signs of past and present geological activity, such as ridges, chaos terrain, and lenticulae. These features suggest that there is heat being generated from within Europa, which is thought to be due to tidal heating caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. Additionally, the surface of Europa is subject to bombardment by radiation from Jupiter, which can cause the ice to darken and form a reddish-brown color in some areas. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists call \"chaos terrain.\"\n|user|: Who funds the Clipper mission?\n|assistant|: The Europa Clipper mission is funded by NASA, which is a U.S. government agency responsible for civilian space exploration and aeronautics research.

The mission's three main science objectives are to understand the nature of the ice shell and the ocean beneath it, to investigate its composition, and to characterize its geology. The mission\u2019s detailed exploration of Europa will help scientists better understand the astrobiological potential for habitable worlds beyond our planet.\n|user|: I Europa livable for humans?\n|assistant|: Based on the information provided, Europa is not considered directly livable for humans. However, it is considered one of the most promising currently habitable environments in our solar system due to the presence of a vast ocean beneath its icy crust. This ocean could potentially contain conditions suitable for life as we know it. The Europa Clipper mission is designed to investigate whether the moon could have conditions suitable for life, but it is not a life detection mission. Europa could have all the \u201cingredients\u201d needed for life as we know it:\nWater: Twice as much as Earth\u2019s oceans\nOrganics: Essential chemical building blocks from a variety of sourcesEnergy: Chemical energy sources from the surface and the sea floor\n\nStability: Conditions remaining similar for 4 billion years\n|user|: The surface of Jupiter Europa\n|assistant|: The surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa, is made up of ice. It is covered in a thick crust of frozen water that is estimated to be between 10 to 100 kilometers thick. The surface also shows signs of past and present geological activity, such as ridges, chaos terrain, and lenticulae. These features suggest that there is heat being generated from within Europa, which is thought to be due to tidal heating caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. Additionally, the surface of Europa is subject to bombardment by radiation from Jupiter, which can cause the ice to darken and form a reddish-brown color in some areas. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists call \"chaos terrain.\"\n|user|: Who funds the Clipper mission?\n|assistant|: The Europa Clipper mission is funded by NASA, which is a U.S. government agency responsible for civilian space exploration and aeronautics research. NASA's budget comes primarily from Congressional appropriations. The total contract award amount for launch services is approximately $178 million.\n|user|: Does NASA have an intern program?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA does offer an internship program. The NASA Internships program is for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as educators, and provides students with the opportunity to work with professionals in their field of interest and gain valuable experience. You can find more information about the program and how to apply on NASA's official website. I'm not a science or engineering student. Can I still get an internship at NASA?\n\nYes! Interns may support a variety of business and program management work, including human resources, administration and program analysis, accounting and budget, communication and public relations, procurement and contracts, information technology, security, and education. No matter your academic major, you\u2019ll find that NASA is a place where you\u2019ll belong to a supportive community that values your background, perspective, and life experiences.\n|user|: Does Clipper have an antennae?"

The vault is bolted to the spacecraft\u2019s propulsion module and has wires to provide communications and control across the entire spacecraft.\nPower\n\nEuropa Clipper\u2019s \u201cwings\u201d - its solar arrays - span more than 100 feet (30.5 meters). Each wing is approximately 46.5 feet (14.2 meters) long and about 13.5 feet (4.1 meters) high. The huge arrays are needed to collect sunlight to power the spacecraft while it operates at Jupiter, which is more than five times as far from the Sun as Earth is.\nCommunications \n\nEuropa Clipper\u2019s 10-foot-diameter (3-meter-diameter) high-gain antenna (HGA) and other smaller radio antennas will be used to receive commands from Earth through NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network. The antennas also will send data back to engineers and scientists. Europa Clipper\u2019s antennas also will be used for gravity and radio science investigations, allowing scientists to study Europa\u2019s gravity as the moon orbits Jupiter.\nGuidance, Navigation, & Control\n\nEuropa Clipper will use sensors, cameras, and special hardware to determine and control its position in space. Europa Clipper\u2019s two stellar reference units, informally called \u201cstar trackers,\u201d are small cameras with a computer that carries a catalog of stars with known positions. \nAs the cameras observes the starry sky, the computer matches the pattern of stars in the images to its star catalog and determines the spacecraft's orientation in space. Europa Clipper will also use four reaction wheels to stay pointed in the right direction.",

With respect to its gravity science role, scientists will use the radio signals exchanged between the telecom sub-system aboard the spacecraft and NASA's Deep Space Network to detect subtle variations in the gravitational attraction between Europa and Europa Clipper. The variations reflect details of Europa\u2019s internal mass distribution, allowing us to learn about Europa\u2019s interior structure.\n\nThe Europa Clipper mission intends to answer the big question: Is Europa habitable? This question encompasses hypotheses about the nature of water, chemistry, and energy exchange at Europa, which in turn leads to these additional major questions to be answered: How deep and salty is the ocean? How thick is the ice shell? How active is the ice shell? Are there plumes, and if so, what is in the plumes?",

Fully deployed, the spacecraft will be more than 5 meters (15 feet) tall, 17 meters (50 feet) long, and will span about 30 meters (100 feet) in width \u2014 longer than a basketball court from tip to tip of its solar arrays. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\nDownload Options\n\nThe solar panels and overall physical structure visible in the interactive model are aspects of spacecraft subsystems that comprise the flight system. The science instruments, attached directly to the spacecraft or through a boom, are referred to as the payload. Europa Clipper\u2019s antennas fall into both of these categories; some antennas provide only a spacecraft (telecom) function, other antennas provide only a science function (for the radar), and yet others perform both telecom and science (gravity and radio science) roles.\nThe Europa Clipper flight system design incorporates lessons learned from prior missions; the scientific instruments are at least partly based on interplanetary mission predecessors. Informed by those experiences, the spacecraft and its components are designed to be appropriately robust to the Europa environment. Europa Clipper\u2019s components also need to be mutually compatible with one another while being operated. Given that, the testing and performance verification is designed to reflect \u201cflying conditions\u201d as well as possible. Let\u2019s look at two subsystems whose fabrication is underway.\n\nNASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) engineers align the upper and lower cylinders of Europa Clipper\u2019s propulsion module for a fit check. Credit: NASA/B. Lambert\n\nThe propulsion subsystem is essentially Europa Clipper\u2019s \u201cgas tank.\u201d It will carry fuel and oxidizer sufficient to change Europa Clipper\u2019s velocity by about 3,600 miles per hour (5,800 kilometers per hour). While this is a large amount and a critically important capability, it represents about five percent of the velocity change needed to accomplish this mission. The bulk of the velocity change necessary to adjust trajectories once in Jupiter orbit will come from gravitational flybys of Jovian moons as planned. Given the overall size of the tanks, the propulsion subsystem is designed as part of a \u201cpropulsion module\u201d that includes the solar arrays and radiation monitors.",

It is covered in a thick crust of frozen water that is estimated to be between 10 to 100 kilometers thick. The surface also shows signs of past and present geological activity, such as ridges, chaos terrain, and lenticulae. These features suggest that there is heat being generated from within Europa, which is thought to be due to tidal heating caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. Additionally, the surface of Europa is subject to bombardment by radiation from Jupiter, which can cause the ice to darken and form a reddish-brown color in some areas. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists call \"chaos terrain.\"\n|user|: Who funds the Clipper mission?\n|assistant|: The Europa Clipper mission is funded by NASA, which is a U.S. government agency responsible for civilian space exploration and aeronautics research. NASA's budget comes primarily from Congressional appropriations. The total contract award amount for launch services is approximately $178 million.\n|user|: Does NASA have an intern program?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA does offer an internship program. The NASA Internships program is for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as educators, and provides students with the opportunity to work with professionals in their field of interest and gain valuable experience.

Europa could have all the \u201cingredients\u201d needed for life as we know it:\nWater: Twice as much as Earth\u2019s oceans\nOrganics: Essential chemical building blocks from a variety of sourcesEnergy: Chemical energy sources from the surface and the sea floor\n\nStability: Conditions remaining similar for 4 billion years\n|user|: The surface of Jupiter Europa\n|assistant|: The surface of Jupiter's moon, Europa, is made up of ice. It is covered in a thick crust of frozen water that is estimated to be between 10 to 100 kilometers thick. The surface also shows signs of past and present geological activity, such as ridges, chaos terrain, and lenticulae. These features suggest that there is heat being generated from within Europa, which is thought to be due to tidal heating caused by Jupiter's gravitational pull. Additionally, the surface of Europa is subject to bombardment by radiation from Jupiter, which can cause the ice to darken and form a reddish-brown color in some areas. The surface of Jupiter's moon Europa features a widely varied landscape, including ridges, bands, small rounded domes and disrupted spaces that geologists call \"chaos terrain.\"\n|user|: Who funds the Clipper mission?\n|assistant|: The Europa Clipper mission is funded by NASA, which is a U.S. government agency responsible for civilian space exploration and aeronautics research. NASA's budget comes primarily from Congressional appropriations. The total contract award amount for launch services is approximately $178 million.\n|user|: Does NASA have an intern program?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA does offer an internship program. The NASA Internships program is for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, as well as educators, and provides students with the opportunity to work with professionals in their field of interest and gain valuable experience. You can find more information about the program and how to apply on NASA's official website. I'm not a science or engineering student. Can I still get an internship at NASA?\n\nYes! Interns may support a variety of business and program management work, including human resources, administration and program analysis, accounting and budget, communication and public relations, procurement and contracts, information technology, security, and education. No matter your academic major, you\u2019ll find that NASA is a place where you\u2019ll belong to a supportive community that values your background, perspective, and life experiences.\n|user|: Does Clipper have an antennae?\n|assistant|: Yes, the Europa Clipper spacecraft has an high-gain antenna. It is used for communication with Earth and sending data back to NASA. Workers were seen installing it on the spacecraft on August 14, 2023. Europa Clipper\u2019s 10-foot-diameter (3-meter-diameter) high-gain antenna (HGA) and other smaller radio antennas will be used to receive commands from Earth through NASA\u2019s Deep Space Network. \n|user|: What is the speed at which Clipper flies?\n|assistant|: The speed at which the Europa Clipper spacecraft flies will vary depending on its trajectory and distance from Jupiter. However, during its closest flybys of Europa, it is expected to reach speeds of around 15,000 to 20,000 miles per hour (6.7 to 9 kilometers per second). It will carry fuel and oxidizer sufficient to change Europa Clipper\u2019s velocity by about 3,600 miles per hour (5,800 kilometers per hour).\n|user|: Does Clipper fly by Europe?"
