      "text": "The typical wedding involves a couple proclaiming their commitment to one another in front of their close relatives and friends , often presided over by a religious figure such as a minister , priest , or rabbi , depending upon the faith of the couple . In traditional Christian ceremonies , the bride 's father will `` give away '' ( hand off ) the bride to the groom . Secular weddings are also common , often presided over by a judge , Justice of the Peace , or other municipal official . At a wedding reception , the father of the bride , in his role as host , regularly offers the first toast , thanking the guests for attending , offering tasteful remembrances of the bride 's childhood , and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together . The best man usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds . A best man 's toast takes the form of a short speech ( 3 -- 5 minutes ) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity . The actual `` toast '' is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy , healthy , loving life together . The maid of honor may follow suit , appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride . The groom may offer the final toast , thanking the bride 's parents for hosting the wedding , the wedding party for their participation , and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids .",

It was introduced by Georgia Representative Bob Barr and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. The Act was intended by Congress to reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. It defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse as a husband or wife of the opposite sex. The bill moved quickly through Congress and was passed by an overwhelming majority in both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress. On July 12, 1996, 342 members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass DOMA, and on September 10, 1996, 84 Senators voted in favor of DOMA. The Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 21, 1996. However, Section 3 of DOMA, which defined marriage and spouse for federal purposes, was struck down by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, in the case of United States v. Windsor. By defining `` spouse '' and its related terms to signify a heterosexual couple in a recognized marriage , Section 3 codified non-recognition of same - sex marriages for all federal purposes , including insurance benefits for government employees , social security survivors ' benefits , immigration , bankruptcy , and the filing of joint tax returns , as well as excluding same - sex spouses from the scope of laws protecting families of federal officers ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 ) , laws evaluating financial aid eligibility , and federal ethics laws applicable to opposite - sex spouses .\n|user|: How is marriage defined?\n|assistant|: According to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as it stood before Section 3 was struck down in 2013, marriage was defined as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife for federal purposes. This definition was used to deny federal recognition to same-sex marriages, which meant that same-sex married couples were not eligible for federal marriage benefits. However, it is important to note that this definition has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. As of now, marriage is legally recognized as a union between two consenting adults, regardless of their sex or gender identity, in many jurisdictions around the world. Same - sex marriage has been legal in the United States since 26 June 2015 .\n|user|: How are weddings celebrated?"

Other occasions include retirement celebrations , housewarming parties , births , etc . The protocol for toasting at weddings is comparatively elaborate and fixed . At a wedding reception , the father of the bride , in his role as host , regularly offers the first toast , thanking the guests for attending , offering tasteful remembrances of the bride 's childhood , and wishing the newlyweds a happy life together . The best man usually proposes a toast in the form of best wishes and congratulations to the newlyweds . A best man 's toast takes the form of a short speech ( 3 -- 5 minutes ) that combines a mixture of humor and sincerity . The humor often comes in the shape of the best man telling jokes at the groom 's expense whilst the sincerity incorporates the praise and complimentary comments that a best man should make about the bride and groom , amongst others . The actual `` toast '' is then delivered at the end of the speech and is a short phrase wishing the newlyweds a happy , healthy , loving life together . The maid of honor may follow suit , appropriately tailoring her comments to the bride . The groom may offer the final toast , thanking the bride 's parents for hosting the wedding , the wedding party for their participation , and finally dedicating the toast to the bridesmaids .",

They can be small, intimate affairs with only close family and friends in attendance, or they can be large, elaborate events with hundreds of guests.

                      "model_text": "|user|: what is the defense of marriage act 1996\n|assistant|: The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is a United States federal law enacted in 1996. It was introduced by Georgia Representative Bob Barr and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. The Act was intended by Congress to reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. It defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse as a husband or wife of the opposite sex. The bill moved quickly through Congress and was passed by an overwhelming majority in both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress. On July 12, 1996, 342 members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass DOMA, and on September 10, 1996, 84 Senators voted in favor of DOMA. The Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 21, 1996. However, Section 3 of DOMA, which defined marriage and spouse for federal purposes, was struck down by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, in the case of United States v. Windsor. By defining `` spouse '' and its related terms to signify a heterosexual couple in a recognized marriage , Section 3 codified non-recognition of same - sex marriages for all federal purposes , including insurance benefits for government employees , social security survivors ' benefits , immigration , bankruptcy , and the filing of joint tax returns , as well as excluding same - sex spouses from the scope of laws protecting families of federal officers ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 ) , laws evaluating financial aid eligibility , and federal ethics laws applicable to opposite - sex spouses .\n|user|: How is marriage defined?\n|assistant|: According to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as it stood before Section 3 was struck down in 2013, marriage was defined as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife for federal purposes. This definition was used to deny federal recognition to same-sex marriages, which meant that same-sex married couples were not eligible for federal marriage benefits. However, it is important to note that this definition has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. As of now, marriage is legally recognized as a union between two consenting adults, regardless of their sex or gender identity, in many jurisdictions around the world. Same - sex marriage has been legal in the United States since 26 June 2015 .\n|user|: How are weddings celebrated?\n|assistant|: The way weddings are celebrated can vary greatly depending on cultural, religious, and personal preferences. Generally, a wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. It often involves an exchange of vows and the exchange of symbolic items such as rings. Weddings can be civil or religious and can take place in a variety of locations, from a courthouse or a church to a beach or a garden. They can be small, intimate affairs with only close family and friends in attendance, or they can be large, elaborate events with hundreds of guests. There are also many traditions and customs associated with weddings, such as the bride wearing a white dress, the groom wearing a tuxedo, and the throwing of the bouquet. However, these traditions can also vary and are often adapted to suit the couple's personal style and beliefs. Ultimately, the most important aspect of a wedding is the commitment being made between the two people getting married. In traditional Christian ceremonies , the bride 's father will `` give away '' ( hand off ) the bride to the groom .

It was introduced by Georgia Representative Bob Barr and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. The Act was intended by Congress to reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. It defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse as a husband or wife of the opposite sex. The bill moved quickly through Congress and was passed by an overwhelming majority in both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress. On July 12, 1996, 342 members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass DOMA, and on September 10, 1996, 84 Senators voted in favor of DOMA. The Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 21, 1996. However, Section 3 of DOMA, which defined marriage and spouse for federal purposes, was struck down by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, in the case of United States v. Windsor. By defining `` spouse '' and its related terms to signify a heterosexual couple in a recognized marriage , Section 3 codified non-recognition of same - sex marriages for all federal purposes , including insurance benefits for government employees , social security survivors ' benefits , immigration , bankruptcy , and the filing of joint tax returns , as well as excluding same - sex spouses from the scope of laws protecting families of federal officers ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 ) , laws evaluating financial aid eligibility , and federal ethics laws applicable to opposite - sex spouses .\n|user|: How is marriage defined?\n|assistant|: According to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as it stood before Section 3 was struck down in 2013, marriage was defined as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife for federal purposes. This definition was used to deny federal recognition to same-sex marriages, which meant that same-sex married couples were not eligible for federal marriage benefits. However, it is important to note that this definition has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. As of now, marriage is legally recognized as a union between two consenting adults, regardless of their sex or gender identity, in many jurisdictions around the world. Same - sex marriage has been legal in the United States since 26 June 2015 .\n|user|: How are weddings celebrated?\n|assistant|: The way weddings are celebrated can vary greatly depending on cultural, religious, and personal preferences. Generally, a wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. It often involves an exchange of vows and the exchange of symbolic items such as rings. Weddings can be civil or religious and can take place in a variety of locations, from a courthouse or a church to a beach or a garden. They can be small, intimate affairs with only close family and friends in attendance, or they can be large, elaborate events with hundreds of guests. There are also many traditions and customs associated with weddings, such as the bride wearing a white dress, the groom wearing a tuxedo, and the throwing of the bouquet. However, these traditions can also vary and are often adapted to suit the couple's personal style and beliefs. Ultimately, the most important aspect of a wedding is the commitment being made between the two people getting married. In traditional Christian ceremonies , the bride 's father will `` give away '' ( hand off ) the bride to the groom . Secular weddings are also common , often presided over by a judge , Justice of the Peace , or other municipal official .\n|user|: What is the meaning of the glass being broken at a Jewish wedding?\n|assistant|: At a Jewish wedding, the breaking of a glass is a significant custom that takes place at the end of the ceremony. It is typically performed by the groom, although some couples choose to do it together. The breaking of the glass has several meanings and interpretations. One common explanation is that it serves as a reminder of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. It is also seen as a symbol of the fragility of human relationships and the need to protect and cherish them. Another interpretation is that the glass represents the couple's past, and by breaking it, they are symbolically leaving it behind and starting their new life together. Regardless of the exact meaning, the breaking of the glass is a powerful and emotional moment that adds depth and significance to the wedding ceremony. After the glass is broken, the guests typically shout \"Mazel Tov!\" which means \"good luck\" or \"congratulations\" in Hebrew. The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered . This is based on two accounts in the Talmud of rabbis who , upon seeing that their son 's wedding celebration was getting out of hand , broke a vessel -- in the second case a glass -- to calm things down . \n|user|: Do all states allow same sex marriages?\n|assistant|: As of the time when the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was in effect, it allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states.

Another interpretation is that the glass represents the couple's past, and by breaking it, they are symbolically leaving it behind and starting their new life together. Regardless of the exact meaning, the breaking of the glass is a powerful and emotional moment that adds depth and significance to the wedding ceremony. After the glass is broken, the guests typically shout \"Mazel Tov!\" which means \"good luck\" or \"congratulations\" in Hebrew. The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered .

Windsor case in 2013, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) prevented same-sex married couples from being recognized as \"spouses\" for purposes of federal laws, which effectively barred them from receiving federal marriage benefits, including immigration benefits. However, after the Supreme Court's decision in 2013, same-sex married couples became eligible for the same immigration benefits as different-sex married couples.\nUnder U.S. immigration law, a U.S. citizen or permanent resident can sponsor their spouse for a green card, allowing them to live and work in the United States permanently. This process is known as \"family-based immigration.\" With the repeal of DOMA, same-sex married couples are now able to take advantage of this process, just like different-sex married couples.\nIt's worth noting that the immigration process for same-sex couples can still be complex, particularly if the couple lives in a state or country that does not recognize same-sex marriage. However, with the help of an experienced immigration attorney, same-sex couples can navigate the process and secure the immigration benefits they are entitled to."

It was introduced by Georgia Representative Bob Barr and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. The Act was intended by Congress to reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. It defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse as a husband or wife of the opposite sex. The bill moved quickly through Congress and was passed by an overwhelming majority in both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress. On July 12, 1996, 342 members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass DOMA, and on September 10, 1996, 84 Senators voted in favor of DOMA. The Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 21, 1996. However, Section 3 of DOMA, which defined marriage and spouse for federal purposes, was struck down by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, in the case of United States v. Windsor. By defining `` spouse '' and its related terms to signify a heterosexual couple in a recognized marriage , Section 3 codified non-recognition of same - sex marriages for all federal purposes , including insurance benefits for government employees , social security survivors ' benefits , immigration , bankruptcy , and the filing of joint tax returns , as well as excluding same - sex spouses from the scope of laws protecting families of federal officers ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 ) , laws evaluating financial aid eligibility , and federal ethics laws applicable to opposite - sex spouses .\n|user|: How is marriage defined?\n|assistant|: According to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as it stood before Section 3 was struck down in 2013, marriage was defined as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife for federal purposes. This definition was used to deny federal recognition to same-sex marriages, which meant that same-sex married couples were not eligible for federal marriage benefits. However, it is important to note that this definition has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. As of now, marriage is legally recognized as a union between two consenting adults, regardless of their sex or gender identity, in many jurisdictions around the world. Same - sex marriage has been legal in the United States since 26 June 2015 .\n|user|: How are weddings celebrated?\n|assistant|: The way weddings are celebrated can vary greatly depending on cultural, religious, and personal preferences. Generally, a wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. It often involves an exchange of vows and the exchange of symbolic items such as rings. Weddings can be civil or religious and can take place in a variety of locations, from a courthouse or a church to a beach or a garden. They can be small, intimate affairs with only close family and friends in attendance, or they can be large, elaborate events with hundreds of guests. There are also many traditions and customs associated with weddings, such as the bride wearing a white dress, the groom wearing a tuxedo, and the throwing of the bouquet. However, these traditions can also vary and are often adapted to suit the couple's personal style and beliefs. Ultimately, the most important aspect of a wedding is the commitment being made between the two people getting married. In traditional Christian ceremonies , the bride 's father will `` give away '' ( hand off ) the bride to the groom . Secular weddings are also common , often presided over by a judge , Justice of the Peace , or other municipal official .\n|user|: What is the meaning of the glass being broken at a Jewish wedding?\n|assistant|: At a Jewish wedding, the breaking of a glass is a significant custom that takes place at the end of the ceremony. It is typically performed by the groom, although some couples choose to do it together. The breaking of the glass has several meanings and interpretations. One common explanation is that it serves as a reminder of the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem. It is also seen as a symbol of the fragility of human relationships and the need to protect and cherish them. Another interpretation is that the glass represents the couple's past, and by breaking it, they are symbolically leaving it behind and starting their new life together. Regardless of the exact meaning, the breaking of the glass is a powerful and emotional moment that adds depth and significance to the wedding ceremony. After the glass is broken, the guests typically shout \"Mazel Tov!\" which means \"good luck\" or \"congratulations\" in Hebrew. The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered . This is based on two accounts in the Talmud of rabbis who , upon seeing that their son 's wedding celebration was getting out of hand , broke a vessel -- in the second case a glass -- to calm things down . \n|user|: Do all states allow same sex marriages?\n|assistant|: As of the time when the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) was in effect, it allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages granted under the laws of other states. Therefore, not all states allowed same-sex marriages. However, after the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell v. Hodges in 2015, same-sex marriage became legal nationwide in the United States, requiring all states to recognize and perform same-sex marriages. Therefore, currently, all states allow same-sex marriages. Society of the United States Marriage laws are established by individual states . Same - sex marriage has been legal in the United States since 26 June 2015 .\n|user|: Can same sex couples adopt children?\n|assistant|: Yes, same-sex couples can adopt children. Adoption laws vary by state, but as of 2021, every state allows joint adoption by same-sex couples. Some states even have laws specifically prohibiting discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals in the adoption process. However, there may still be challenges and barriers for same-sex couples seeking to adopt, such as biased agencies or individuals, or discriminatory policies in certain states. But overall, same-sex couples have the same rights and opportunities as different-sex couples when it comes to adopting children.\n|user|: Legal immigration for same sex couples.\n|assistant|: Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in the United States v. Windsor case in 2013, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) prevented same-sex married couples from being recognized as \"spouses\" for purposes of federal laws, which effectively barred them from receiving federal marriage benefits, including immigration benefits. However, after the Supreme Court's decision in 2013, same-sex married couples became eligible for the same immigration benefits as different-sex married couples. Under U.S. immigration law, a U.S. citizen or permanent resident can sponsor their spouse for a green card, allowing them to live and work in the United States permanently. This process is known as \"family-based immigration.\" With the repeal of DOMA, same-sex married couples are now able to take advantage of this process, just like different-sex married couples. It's worth noting that the immigration process for same-sex couples can still be complex, particularly if the couple lives in a state or country that does not recognize same-sex marriage. However, with the help of an experienced immigration attorney, same-sex couples can navigate the process and secure the immigration benefits they are entitled to. On April 2 , 2012 , five bi-national same - sex couples represented by Immigration Equality and Paul , Weiss filed a lawsuit , Blesch v. Holder , in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York , claiming that Section 3 of DOMA violated their equal protection rights by denying the U.S. citizen in the relationship the same rights in the green card application process granted a U.S. citizen who is in a relationship of partners of the opposite sex .\n|user|: Restrictions to immigration."

      "original_text": "There can be various restrictions to immigration in the United States, some of which may affect same-sex couples. These restrictions can include:\n1. Eligibility requirements: To be eligible for immigration benefits, individuals must meet certain requirements, such as passing medical exams, background checks, and providing necessary documentation.\n2. Inadmissibility grounds: Certain individuals may be inadmissible to the United States due to factors such as criminal history, security risks, or health issues.\n3. Numerical limitations: There are limits to the number of visas that can be issued each year in certain categories, which can result in wait times for some applicants.\n4. DOMA restrictions (prior to 2013): Before the Supreme Court's ruling in the United States v. Windsor case in 2013, the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) prevented same-sex married couples from being recognized as \"spouses\" for purposes of federal laws, which effectively barred them from receiving federal marriage benefits, including immigration benefits.\nHowever, after the Supreme Court's decision in 2013, same-sex married couples became eligible for the same immigration benefits as different-sex married couples. It's worth noting that the immigration process for same-sex couples can still be complex, particularly if the couple lives in a state or country that does not recognize same-sex marriage. However, with the help of an experienced immigration attorney, same-sex couples can navigate the process and secure the immigration benefits they are entitled to."
