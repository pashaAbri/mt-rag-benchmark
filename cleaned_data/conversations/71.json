When it receives this response, the client application recognizes that the get_weather action is being requested. It calls an external web service (/weather) to get the actual forecast information, passing any specified parameters (such as the user's location). The client application then stores the returned information in context variable specified in the action request ($weather_forecast).\n4. The client application sends another message to the service, including the updated context that contains the weather forecast information. From the dialog's perspective, this message is effectively the next round of user input, although the actual input text is blank.\n5.

At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person.

Instead of asking the customer to retry or rephrase the question over and over, your assistant can offer to transfer the customer to a human agent.\n\n\n\nTo design a dialog that can transfer the conversation, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Add an intent to your skill that can recognize a user's request to speak to a human.\n\nYou can create your own intent or add the prebuilt intent named General_Connect_to_Agent that is provided with the General content catalog.\n2. Add a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step.

Add meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it. To ensure that a useful summary is provided to service desk agents when a conversation is transferred to them, add short dialog node names that reflect the node's purpose. For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.",

For more information about this offering, see [What is PostgreSQL?](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/databases-for-postgresql).\n\nThis getting started tutorial incurs costs. You must have an [IBM Cloud Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) account to proceed. Make sure that you review pricing information for [classic VSIs](https://cloud.ibm.com/gen1/infrastructure/provision/vs) and [PostgreSQL](https://cloud.ibm.com/databases/databases-for-postgresql/create).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you can use this template, you must complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Make sure that you have the permissions to [create classic virtual servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/virtual-servers?topic=virtual-servers-managing-device-access).",

After this date, IBM Blockchain Platform SaaS networks that are not migrated to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric will be at risk for potential security vulnerabilities. A migration tool is provided from your console, and the disruption to your network is minimal. See [Migrating to IBM Support for Hyperledger Fabric](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-migrating-to-hlf-support) for details.\n\nThis guide helps you understand the pricing model for IBM\u00ae Blockchain Platform for IBM Cloud, and how much you will pay when you develop and grow your blockchain network of peers, ordering nodes, and Certificate Authorities components, which are based on Hyperledger Fabric v2.2.10.\n\n\n\n Pricing model \n\nIBM Blockchain Platform introduces a new hourly pricing model that is based on virtual processor core (VPC) allocation. This simplified model is based on the amount of CPU (or VPC) that your IBM Blockchain Platform nodes are allocated on an hourly basis, at a flat rate of $0.29 USD/VPC-hour.\n\nA VPC is a unit of measurement that is used to determine the licensing cost of IBM products. It is based on the number of virtual cores (vCPUs) that are available to the product. A vCPU is a virtual core that is assigned to a virtual machine or a physical processor core. For IBM Blockchain Platform cost estimation purposes, 1 VPC = 1 CPU = 1 vCPU = 1 Core. The term \"VPC\" is also used to refer to a type of infrastructure on IBM Cloud and is unrelated to this topic.\n\nFor a total cost estimate, remember that your blockchain network consists of an Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud that contains IBM Blockchain Platform components and uses storage of your choice.

A VPC gives you the security of a private cloud environment with the dynamic scalability of a public cloud.\n|user|: How to create a cluster.\n|assistant|: To create a cluster, this section steps through the build tasks needed to create the Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC) and the availability group. This guide assumes that you: Have at least two servers running Windows 2019 and SQL Server 2019 to cluster. Have a bastion host with external Internet access. Have deployed active directory.                                                                          Or you can:                                                                                      Try out Automating cluster creation with IBM Cloud Schematics templates.  \n|user|: How much do the IBM Cloud Schematics templates cost?\n|assistant|: This getting started tutorial incurs costs. You must have an IBM Cloud Pay-As-You-Go or Subscription account to proceed. IBM Cloud Schematics Workspaces are provided to you at no cost. However, when you decide to apply your Terraform template in IBM Cloud by clicking Apply plan from the workspace details page or running the IBM cloud schematics apply command, you are charged for the IBM Cloud resources that are described in your Terraform template.\n|user|: And what is the charge for VPC?\n|assistant|: Pay for only what you use, no minimum VPC hourly package is required, which makes it very inexpensive to get started.  IBM Blockchain Platform introduces a new hourly pricing model that is based on virtual processor core (VPC) allocation. This simplified model is based on the amount of CPU (or VPC) that your IBM Blockchain Platform nodes are allocated on an hourly basis, at a flat rate of $0.29 USD/VPC-hour.\n|user|: Is storage included in the VPC price?"

          "text": "\nFor IBM Blockchain Platform cost estimation purposes, 1 VPC = 1 CPU = 1 vCPU = 1 Core. The term \"VPC\" is also used to refer to a type of infrastructure on IBM Cloud and is unrelated to this topic.\n\nFor a total cost estimate, remember that your blockchain network consists of an Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud that contains IBM Blockchain Platform components and uses storage of your choice. Your Kubernetes cluster on IBM Cloud and the storage that you choose incur separate charges. You will not be charged for the cluster that the Operational Tooling instance, also known as the console, is running on. See the [Architecture reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/blockchain?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-overviewibp-console-overview-architecture) topic for an illustration. More details on how to calculate charges are described below.\n\n\n\n Benefits of the new pricing model \n\n\n\n* No membership fees: Freedom from membership fees means that you can invest directly in your blockchain components.\n* Estimation clarity: A simple hourly pricing model makes cost estimation clear and easy by using the cost estimator tool that is available in the IBM Cloud dashboard.\n* No minimum fee required: Pay for only what you use, no minimum VPC hourly package is required, which makes it very inexpensive to get started.\n* Scalability of compute: You have the option to scale your compute up during peak usage periods or down to a minute fraction of capacity for when the compute is not needed to minimize expense.\n\n\n\nIn summary, these features remove the complexity of accounting for membership limitations or purchasing compute ahead of your needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Find out how to preview the platform free for 30 days \n\nYou can preview the IBM Blockchain Platform at no charge for 30 days when you link your IBM Blockchain Platform service instance to an IBM Cloud Kubernetes free cluster.\n\nLimitations of the free preview\n\n\n\n* Performance will be limited by throughput, storage, and functionality. Read more about the [limitations of free clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_ovcluster_types).\n* IBM Cloud will delete your Kubernetes cluster after 30 days.",
