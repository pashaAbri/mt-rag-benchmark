As the dialog node response, add a Connect to human agent response type. At run time, if the user asks to speak to someone, this node is triggered and a transfer is initiated on the user's behalf.\n* When the conversation broaches a topic that is sensitive in nature, you can start a transfer.\n\nFor example, an insurance company might want questions about bereavement benefits always to be handled by a person. Or, if a customer wants to close an account, you might want to transfer the conversation to a respresentative who is authorized to offer incentives to keep the customer's business.\n* When the assistant repeatedly fails to understand a customer's request. Instead of asking the customer to retry or rephrase the question over and over, your assistant can offer to transfer the customer to a human agent.\n\n\n\nTo design a dialog that can transfer the conversation, complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Add an intent to your skill that can recognize a user's request to speak to a human.\n\nYou can create your own intent or add the prebuilt intent named General_Connect_to_Agent that is provided with the General content catalog.\n2. Add a root node to your dialog that conditions on the intent you created in the previous step. Choose Connect to human agent as the response type.\n\nFor more information, see [Adding a Connect to human agent response type](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-overviewdialog-overview-add-connect-to-human-agent).\n3. Add meaningful names to the dialog nodes in your dialog.\n\nWhen a conversation is transferred to an agent, the name of the most-recently processed dialog node is sent with it. To ensure that a useful summary is provided to service desk agents when a conversation is transferred to them, add short dialog node names that reflect the node's purpose. For example, Find a store.\n\nSome older skills specify the purpose of the node in the external node name field instead.",

By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating intents \n\n\n\n1. Open your dialog skill. The skill opens to the Intents page.\n2. Select Create intent.\n3. In the Intent name field, type a name for the intent.\n\n\n\n* The intent name can contain letters (in Unicode), numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods.\n* The name cannot consist of .. or any other string of only periods.\n* Intent names cannot contain spaces and must not exceed 128 characters. The following are examples of intent names:\n\n\n\n* weather_conditions",

The Anything else node is what enables your assistant to (if nothing else) say, I'm sorry, I didn't understand. or I can't help you with that.\n* The skill's analytics feature uses this node to learn about the topics that your dialog can't address. The coverage metric looks for occurrences of nodes with the anything_else condition being processed in the user conversation logs. It uses this information to determine the frequency with which your dialog is able to match user requests to intents that can address them. The node is registered by the metric if it conditions on anything_else alone or when it's used in combination with another condition, such as anything_else && positive_feedback.",

The response might be the answer to a question such as Where can I get some gas? or the execution of a command, such as turning on the radio. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree.

Skills enable you to extend the functionality of your assistant by incorporating specialized services or features. For instance, you could add a conversational dialog skill to enhance the conversational abilities of your assistant, or you might add a search skill to enable your assistant to perform complex searches within a specific dataset. By adding skills, you can tailor your assistant to better meet the needs of your users and provide a more engaging and interactive experience."

The search skill interacts with the IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery service to extract this information from a configured data collection.\n\nIf you already use the Discovery service, you can mine your existing data collections for source material that you can share with customers to address their questions.\n\nHowever, you do not need to have a Discovery service instance. If you choose to create a search skill, a free instance of Discovery is provisioned for you. You can then create a collection from a data source and configure your search skill to search this collection for answers to customer queries.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how user input is processed when both a dialog skill and a search skill are added to an assistant. Any questions that the dialog is not designed to answer are sent to the search skill, which finds a relevant response from a Discovery data collection.\n\n![Diagram of how a question gets routed to the search skill.]",
