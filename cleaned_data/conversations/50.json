Note that there are two separate sets of roles:\n\n\n\n* Platform access\n* Service access\n\n\n\nYou need platform access roles to create and manage service instances, while service access roles perform service-specific operations on service instances. In the console, these settings can be updated by selecting Manage > Security > Identity and Access.\n\n\n\n\n\n Why is my domain in Pending state? How do I activate it? \n\nWhen you add a domain to CIS, we give you a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain remains in pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Make sure you add both the name servers to your registrar or DNS provider. We periodically scan the public DNS system to check whether the name servers have been configured as instructed. As soon as we are able to verify the name server change (which can take up to 24 hours), we activate your domain.",

But they can also decide to create a private data collection on the smart contract that governs their business interactions to maintain privacy over sensitive aspects of the sale, such as the price, without having to create a secondary channel. To learn more about when to use private data within a blockchain, visit the [Private Data](https://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/release-1.4/private-data/private-data.htmlprivate-data) concept article in the Fabric documentation.\n\nIn order to use private data with IBM Blockchain Platform, the following three conditions must be satisfied:\n\n\n\n1. Define the private data collection. A private data collection file can be added to your smart contract. Then, at run time, your client application can use private data-specific chaincode APIs to input and retrieve data from the collection. For more information about how to use private data collections with your smart contract, see the Fabric SDK tutorial on [Using private data](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/tutorial-private-data.html) in the Fabric SDK documentation.\n2. Deploy the smart contract. After you define the smart contract private data collection, you need to install the smart contract on the peers that are members of the channel. When you instantiate the smart contract on the channel by using the console, you need to upload the collection configuration JSON file. For more information on how to [create a collection definition JSON file](https://hyperledger.github.io/fabric-sdk-node/release-1.4/tutorial-private-data.html) see the Fabric SDK documentation topic.",

It is only available for customers at the Enterprise or Security plan level.\n\nWhen mTLS is configured, access is granted only to requests with a corresponding client certificate. When a request reaches the application, CIS responds with a request for the client certificate. If the client fails to present the certificate, the request is not allowed to proceed. Otherwise, the key exchange proceeds.\n\nZoom\n\n![Diagram of mTLS handshake](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/cb1eb27836421578019401fa7556779109430b29/cis/images/mtls-handshake.png)\n\nFigure 1. Diagram of an mTLS handshake\n\n\n\n Configuring mutual TLS \n\nMutual TLS is not enabled by default. It is an additional service that requires prior authorization and enablement.\n\nTo obtain authorization, you must submit an IBM Support case.\n\nAfter mTLS is turned on for your account, take the following steps to enable it.\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the Security page in the CIS UI.\n2. Select the Mutual TLS tab.\n3. Click Enable to enable the feature.\n\n\n\nAfter mTLS is enabled, it cannot be disabled.\n\nTo set up mTLS authentication in the IBM Cloud Internet Services UI for a particular endpoint:\n\n\n\n1. In the Root certificates table, click Add to define a new root certificate.\n2. Paste the certificate content into the content field, provide a name for the Root CA, and add one or more fully qualified domain names (FQDN) of the endpoints that you want to use this certificate. These FQDNs are the hostnames that are used for the resources being protected by the application policy. You must associate the Root CA with the FQDN that the application being protected uses.\n3. Click Save.\n\nIf your zone is using an intermediate certificate in addition to the root certificate, upload the entire chain.\n4.",
