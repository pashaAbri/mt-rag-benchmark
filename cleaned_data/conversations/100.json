By scheduling automatic rotation of your secrets at regular intervals, you can reduce the likelihood of compromise and ensure that your credentials never expire.\n\nAutomatic rotation is available only for secrets that are generated by Secrets Manager. If the secret was imported initially, you must provide new secret data to rotate it. For more information, see [Manually rotating secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manual-rotation).\n\n\n\n Before you begin \n\nBefore you get started, be sure that you have the required level of access.

Review the following suggested guidelines for implementing best practices around your secrets management.\n\n\n\n Define your rotation strategy \n\nAs you use Secrets Manager to design your secrets management strategy, consider how often you want to rotate your secrets based on the internal guidelines for your organization. Determine ahead of time which users or service IDs require access to rotate secrets, and how those secrets can be rotated manually to avoid interruptions to your applications.\n\n\n\n1. Determine a frequency of rotation for your secrets.\n\nAfter you store a secret in Secrets Manager, you decide the frequency of its rotation. You might want to rotate secrets due to personnel turnover, process malfunction, or according to your organization's internal guidelines. Rotate your secrets regularly, for example every 90 days, to meet best practices around secrets management.\n2. Test out rotation workflows for each type of secret that you manage in Secrets Manager.\n\nThe way in which Secrets Manager evaluates a request to rotate a secret differs depending on the type of secret. For example, some secrets are replaced immediately with the data that you provide on rotation, whereas other secrets, such as public certificates, move into an extra validation step. For more information about how Secrets Manager handles rotation requests, see [Manually rotating secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-manual-rotationmanual-rotate-by-type).\n3. Establish a process for deploying the newest secret versions to your applications.\n\nUse an automated flow to obtain and deploy the latest version of your secret after it is rotated. For more information, see [Avoid application outages by locking your secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-best-practices-rotate-secretsbest-practices-lock-secrets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Set up alerts for expiring secrets \n\nConnect to the Event Notifications service so that Secrets Manager can notify you in advance when your secrets or certificates are about to expire.\n\n\n\n1.

Users are identified by their IBMid. Services are identified by their service IDs. And, resources are identified and addressed by using CRNs.\n\nThe IBM Cloud IAM Token Service is used to create, update, delete, and use API keys for users and services. Those API keys are created either with API calls or the Identity & Access section of the IBM Cloud\u00ae Platform Console. The same key can be used across services. Each user has any number of API keys to support key rotation scenarios, as well as scenarios by using different keys for different purposes to limit the exposure of a single key.\n\nFor more information, see [the IAM documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverviewiamoverview).\n\n\n\n Users and API keys \n\nAPI keys can be created and used by IBM Cloud users for automation and scripting purposes.

It is best to bind Service IDs to a IBM Cloud Platform account. This binding is done to give the Service ID a container to live in.

Secrets that you create in Secrets Manager can be static or dynamic in nature. A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a dynamic secret has its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed. The static code scan stage runs a static code analyzer tool on the specified app repo codebases. The static-scan task runs a scan on the specified repos. The Dynamic scan stage runs a dynamic application security testing tool to find vulnerabilities in the deployed application.\n|user|: Do they both rotate secrets?\n|assistant|: Both dynamic and static secrets can have their expiration dates enforced, leading to the rotation of the secrets. The key difference lies in when this enforcement occurs. For static secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, for dynamic secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced when the secret data is read or accessed. When trying to rotate a secret, the request's success depends on whether the previous version is locked or not. Automatic rotation is available only for secrets that are generated by Secrets Manager. With IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager, you can design a strategy for rotating your secrets and sensitive data.\n|user|: What is an IAM credential?\n|assistant|: IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service securely authenticates users and controls access to all resources consistently in the IBM Cloud Platform. An IAM (Identity and Access Management) credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. These credentials allow you to authenticate your identity and control your access to various IBM Cloud resources.\n|user|: Can I track my users?\n|assistant|: You can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact. The IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. Tracking Instances with IBM Cloud Activity Tracker and Access Management (IAM) service allows you to securely authenticate users and control access to all resources consistently in the IBM Cloud Platform. \n|user|: Are there serverless instances?"

An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running. You can develop and deploy Spark SQL, data transformation, data science, or machine learning jobs using the Spark application API.\n* What are the advantages of IBM Analytics Engine serverless instances?\n\nWith IBM Analytics Engine serverless, compute and memory resources are allocated on demand when Spark workloads are deployed. When an application is not in running state, no computing resources are allocated to the IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance. Pricing is based on the actual amount of resources consumed by the instance, billed on a per second basis.\n* Does the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark support Hadoop?\n\nNo, currently, the IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark only supports Apache Spark.\n* Can I change the instance home storage of a serverless instance?\n\nNo, you can't. After an instance home storage is associated with an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance, it cannot be changed because instance home contains all instance relevant data, such as the Spark events and custom libraries. Changing instance home would result in the loss of the Spark history data and custom libraries.\n* How is user management and access control managed in a serverless instance?\n\nUser management and access control of an IBM Analytics Engine serverless instance and its APIs is done through IBM Cloud\u00ae Identity and Access Management (IAM). You use IAM access policies to invite users to collaborate on your instance and grant them the necessary privileges. See [Granting permissions to users](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/AnalyticsEngine?topic=AnalyticsEngine-grant-permissions-serverless).\n* How do I define the size of the cluster to run my Spark application?\n\nYou can specify the size of the cluster either at the time the instance is created or when submitting Spark applications.",

There are differences between them. Dynamic secrets have their expiration date and time enforced when their secret data is read or accessed, while static secrets have their expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. With a Secrets Manager, you can create, lease, and centrally manage secrets that are used in IBM Cloud services or your custom-built applications.\n|user|: Which one protects more from vulnerabilities?\n|assistant|: Both dynamic and static secrets have their own ways of protecting against vulnerabilities. Secrets that you create in Secrets Manager can be static or dynamic in nature. A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a dynamic secret has its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed. The static code scan stage runs a static code analyzer tool on the specified app repo codebases. The static-scan task runs a scan on the specified repos. The Dynamic scan stage runs a dynamic application security testing tool to find vulnerabilities in the deployed application.\n|user|: Do they both rotate secrets?\n|assistant|: Both dynamic and static secrets can have their expiration dates enforced, leading to the rotation of the secrets. The key difference lies in when this enforcement occurs. For static secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, for dynamic secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced when the secret data is read or accessed. When trying to rotate a secret, the request's success depends on whether the previous version is locked or not. Automatic rotation is available only for secrets that are generated by Secrets Manager. With IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager, you can design a strategy for rotating your secrets and sensitive data.\n|user|: What is an IAM credential?\n|assistant|: IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service securely authenticates users and controls access to all resources consistently in the IBM Cloud Platform. An IAM (Identity and Access Management) credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. These credentials allow you to authenticate your identity and control your access to various IBM Cloud resources.\n|user|: Can I track my users?\n|assistant|: You can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact. The IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. Tracking Instances with IBM Cloud Activity Tracker and Access Management (IAM) service allows you to securely authenticate users and control access to all resources consistently in the IBM Cloud Platform. \n|user|: Are there serverless instances?\n|assistant|: Yes, there are serverless instances in the context of IBM Analytics Engine. The IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark offers a new consumption model using Apache Spark. An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running.\n|user|: Explain Spark."

For more information about creating and storing IAM credentials, see [Creating IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials).\n* What happens when I rotate my secret?\n\nWhen a secret is rotated, a new version of its value becomes available for use.

When the secret reaches its expiration date, it transitions to a Destroyed state. When the transition happens, the value that is associated with the secret is no longer recoverable. The transition to the Destroyed state can take up to a couple of minutes after the secret expires, or a lock that prevented expiration is removed.\n\nFor more information about how your information is protected, see [Securing your data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-mng-data).\n* What are differences between the Reader and SecretsReader roles?\n\nBoth the Reader and SecretsReader roles help you to assign read-only access to Secrets Manager resources.\n\n\n\n* As a reader, you can browse a high-level view of secrets in your instance.",

There are differences between them. Dynamic secrets have their expiration date and time enforced when their secret data is read or accessed, while static secrets have their expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. With a Secrets Manager, you can create, lease, and centrally manage secrets that are used in IBM Cloud services or your custom-built applications.\n|user|: Which one protects more from vulnerabilities?\n|assistant|: Both dynamic and static secrets have their own ways of protecting against vulnerabilities. Secrets that you create in Secrets Manager can be static or dynamic in nature. A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a dynamic secret has its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.

The Dynamic scan stage runs a dynamic application security testing tool to find vulnerabilities in the deployed application.\n|user|: Do they both rotate secrets?\n|assistant|: Both dynamic and static secrets can have their expiration dates enforced, leading to the rotation of the secrets. The key difference lies in when this enforcement occurs. For static secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, for dynamic secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced when the secret data is read or accessed. When trying to rotate a secret, the request's success depends on whether the previous version is locked or not. Automatic rotation is available only for secrets that are generated by Secrets Manager.

An IAM (Identity and Access Management) credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. These credentials allow you to authenticate your identity and control your access to various IBM Cloud resources.\n|user|: Can I track my users?\n|assistant|: You can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact. The IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud.

The IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark offers a new consumption model using Apache Spark. An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running.\n|user|: Explain Spark.\n|assistant|: Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed computing system. There is no limit on the number of Spark applications that can be run in an IBM Analytics Engine service instance. On a Spark 3.1 or Spark 3.3 runtime, you can submit Spark applications written in the following languages: Scala 2.12, Python 3.9, and R 3.6.3. A Spark runtime version comes with default runtime language version. IBM extend support for new language versions and remove the existing language version to keep the runtime free from any security vulnerabilities. Spark can be run on various platforms.\n|user|: Hive metastore client?"
