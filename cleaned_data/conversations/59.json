Cages with solid or wire mesh floors are used , although wire mesh floors can cause injury and may be associated with an infection commonly known as bumblefoot ( ulcerative pododermatitis ) . `` Cubes and Coroplast '' ( C&C ) style cages are now a common choice . Cages are often lined with wood shavings or a similar material . Bedding made from red cedar ( Eastern or Western ) and pine , both softwoods , were commonly used in the past , but these materials are now believed to contain harmful phenols ( aromatic hydrocarbons ) and oils . Safer bedding materials made from hardwoods ( such as aspen ) , paper products , and corn cob materials are other alternatives . Guinea pigs tend to be messy within their cages ; they often jump into their food bowls or kick bedding and feces into them , and their urine sometimes crystallizes on cage surfaces , making it difficult to remove . After its cage has been cleaned , a guinea pig typically urinates and drags its lower body across the floor of the cage to mark its territory . Male guinea pigs may also mark their territory in this way when they are taken out of their cages .",

They do not respond well to sudden changes in their diet and they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types . A constant supply of hay is generally recommended , as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop bad habits if food is not present , such as chewing on their hair .

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .",

Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .",

It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia , particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands ; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador ( mainly in the Sierra ) and Colombia .

Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income , and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large - scale municipal fairs . Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol , and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken . The animal may be served fried ( chactado or frito ) , broiled ( asado ) , or roasted ( al horno ) , and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee .

Statues dating from circa 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses . The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective . These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes , where Western medicine is either unavailable or distrusted .",

          "text": "Guinea pig\nIn English , the term `` guinea pig '' is commonly used as a metaphor for a subject of scientific experimentation , or any experiment or test in modern times . This dates back to the early 20th century ; the Oxford English Dictionary notes its first usage in this capacity in 1913 . In 1933 , Consumers Research founders F.J. Schlink and Arthur Kallet wrote a book entitled 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs , extending the metaphor to consumer society . The book became a national bestseller in the United States , thus further popularizing the term , and spurred the growth of the consumer protection movement . During World War II , the plastic surgeon Archibald McIndoe established the Guinea Pig Club at Queen Victoria Hospital , East Grinstead , Sussex , England as a social club and mutual support network for his patients , who were undergoing previously - untested reconstruction procedures . The negative connotation of the term was later employed in the novel The Guinea Pigs ( 1970 ) by Czech author Ludv\u00edk Vacul\u00edk as an allegory for Soviet totalitarianism . Guinea pigs remained popular laboratory animals until the later 20th century : about 2.5 million guinea pigs were used annually in the U.S. for research in the 1960s , but that total decreased to about 375,000 by the mid-1990s . As of 2007 , they constitute about 2 % of the current total of laboratory animals . In the past , they were widely used to standardize vaccines and antiviral agents ; they were also often employed in studies on the production of antibodies in response to extreme allergic reactions , or anaphylaxis . Less common uses included research in pharmacology and irradiation . Since the middle 20th century , they have been replaced in laboratory contexts primarily by mice and rats . This is in part because research into the genetics of guinea pigs has lagged behind that of other rodents , although geneticists W.E. Castle and Sewall Wright made a number of contributions to this area of study , especially regarding coat color . In 2004 , the U.S. 's National Human Genome Research Institute announced plans to sequence the genome of the domestic guinea pig .",

However, if you're asking about the history of guinea pigs being used in scientific research, they have indeed been used in various medical studies since the 18th century due to their size and relatively short lifespan.\nFor any further queries, feel free to ask!\nUser: No, that's not my question. I'm looking for information about a person who is called a \"human guinea pig.\"\nAssistant: Apologies for the confusion. A \"human guinea pig\" generally refers to a person who voluntarily participates in experiments, trials, or tests of new products, drugs, or procedures, allowing researchers to study their effects or efficacy. These individuals consent to take part in such activities, understanding the associated risks and benefits, and contribute valuable data to advance scientific knowledge and development."

          "text": "Guinea pig\nLike humans , but unlike most other mammals , guinea pigs can not synthesize their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food . If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C , they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy . Guinea pigs require about 10 mg of vitamin C daily ( 20 mg if pregnant ) , which can be obtained through fresh , raw fruits and vegetables ( such as broccoli , apple , cabbage , carrot , celery , and spinach ) or through dietary supplements or by eating fresh pellets designed for guinea pigs , if they have been handled properly . Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , potassium , and hydrogen ions ; but adequate amounts of vitamins A , D , and E are also necessary .",
