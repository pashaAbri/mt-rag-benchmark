Red Hat OpenShift clusters build on Kubernetes container orchestration that offers consistency and flexibility for your development lifecycle operations.\n\nYour Red Hat OpenShift workloads can scale across IBM\u2019s global footprint of data centers and multizone regions. At the same time, you\u2019re able to uniformly monitor, log, and secure apps. Because IBM manages the service, you can focus on innovating with high-value IBM Cloud services and middleware, such as AI and analytics. You also have access to Red Hat packaged open-source tools, including your favorite app runtimes, frameworks, databases, and more.\n\nReady to get started? Try out the [creating a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_tutorial).\n\nChoice of container platform provider\n: Deploy clusters with Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes installed as the container platform orchestrator.\n: Choose the developer experience that fits your company, or run workloads across both Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes clusters.\n: Built-in integrations from the IBM Cloud console to the Kubernetes dashboard or Red Hat OpenShift web console.\n: Single view and management experience of all your Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes clusters from IBM Cloud.",

VMware Solutions and OpenShift\n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift overview \n\nThe Red Hat OpenShift platform is a platform that is designed to orchestrate containerized workloads across a cluster of nodes. The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process. It is accessed by using SSH through the private network. It also hosts a webserver to help the build process of the cluster.",

Migration requires separate clusters; you can't update a cluster from one major version to another. Various open source tools might be used, but are not officially supported. As with standard OpenShift Container Platform, you can't update a cluster from one major version to another. If you use a third-party open source tool such as the [cluster migrator operator](https://github.com/migtools/mig-operator), the tool is not supported by IBM and might have limitations such as the migration UI being unavailable. \n Container-native virtualization You can set up [container-native virtualization add-on](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/virt/about-virt.html) on bare metal machines, but not on virtual machines. Container-native virtualization is not supported by IBM. If you experience issues, you are responsible for resolving the issues and any impact to your workloads.",

It allows you to orchestrate and scale your existing Red Hat OpenShift workloads across on-prem and off-prem clouds for a portable, hybrid solution that works the same in multicloud scenarios. Each cluster in Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud is controlled by a dedicated Red Hat OpenShift master that is managed by IBM in an IBM-owned IBM Cloud infrastructure account. Worker nodes in standard clusters are provisioned in your IBM Cloud infrastructure account, and you are responsible for requesting timely updates to ensure the latest security updates and patches are applied.\nClusters in Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud offer the following benefits:\n1. A managed Red Hat OpenShift master with dedicated compute, networking, and storage resources, continuously monitored by IBM Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) for security, reliability, and availability.\n2. Automatic updates of the patch version, with the requirement for manual updates to master major and minor versions.\n3. Worker nodes dedicated to your account, with the responsibility to request timely updates to ensure the latest security updates and patches are applied.\n4. Seamless integration with IBM Watson\u00ae, AI, IoT, DevOps, security, and data analytics cloud services.\n5. Support for intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management.\nTo learn more about Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud, consider trying out the [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_tutorial)."
