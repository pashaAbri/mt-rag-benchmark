We all enjoy finding a bargain, but do not be fooled by spam emails offering great deals or claiming they support good causes. If it seems too good to be true it probably is. Responding to or clicking on any link within an unsolicited email or pop-up box can put your personal information in jeopardy.\nGive your debit card a break. Be especially wary of using your debit card when shopping online. If an identity thief gets hold of your debit card information, he or she can drain your bank account or open new accounts in your name. If you have a credit card, use it instead. Credit cards typically provide added protection against fraudulent charges.\nBe cautious when downloading mobile applications. Mobile apps often take more data from you than they need, either for their own use or to sell to third parties. To prevent your information from getting into the wrong hands, only download applications from official app stores and check other users\u2019 reviews, as well as the app\u2019s privacy policies, before downloading.\nUse a variety of passwords. If you use the same password for all your online activities, and an identity thief uncovers it, he or she could have access to your bank, email, and other personal accounts. As you shop at different online retailers, choose a different password for each new account that you create. Also, avoid using your name or the names of family members in your password. Social media has made those passwords even easier to crack.\nIdentity Theft Prevention Tips for Traveling\nTraveling offers identity thieves plenty of opportunity to steal your information. Hotel rooms, airplanes and trains, public internet access \u2013 all can be problematic if you let your privacy guard down. The following are successful strategies for safeguarding your identity when away from home.\nClean out your wallet. Before you travel, plan to carry only the necessities for your trip and nothing extra. This way, if your wallet gets misplaced or stolen during your travels, you will have reduced the number of things that need to be replaced, as well as the amount of personal information that could be at risk.\nCopy and disperse copies of your identification.",

Create passwords that employ a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid obvious passwords\u2014never use your birth date, mother\u2019s maiden name, or the last four digits of your Social Security number.\nLock up your records. Keep any financial documents and records containing your sensitive information in a secure place in your home or office. Try to avoid carrying around items that contain your personal information. For digital records, consider the use of encrypted storage drives or password-protected files.\nShred sensitive documents. Tear, cut up, or shred sensitive materials, such as old records, files, bills, prescription labels, or expired credit cards before disposing of them. Once information leaves your hands, there is no way of knowing who may get their hands on it.\nSecure your wireless network. Like public or shared computers, unprotected wireless networks can put sensitive information in jeopardy. Make sure your wireless network at home is protected with a strong password, the default administrator username has been changed, and turn on Wireless Network Encryption if available.\nLock your computer. If you are using a computer at your office or in a public place, make sure to lock it before you walk away to safeguard any personal information stored on the computer.\nProtect against viruses. Regularly update anti-virus protection software on your computer. In addition, keep your computer system and browser up to date and set at the highest security level.\nDouble-check mailings.

Remember, caller ID can be faked. You can always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them before giving any money.\n\n Mail fraud\n \n\nMail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake. A common warning sign is a letter asking you to send money or personal information now to get something valuable after you send the money or information.\n\n Phishing\n \n\nIn phishing, a scammer impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you. These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn\u2019t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts. Read more.\n\n Spoofing\n \n\nSpoofing occurs when a caller disguises the information shown on your caller ID. This gives the caller the ability to disguise or \"spoof\" the name and/or number to appear as though they are calling as a certain person from a specific location.\n\n Wire or money transfer fraud\n \n\nSome scammers trick you into wiring or transferring money to steal from you. One common example of a wire transfer fraud is the \u201cgrandparent scam.\u201d",
