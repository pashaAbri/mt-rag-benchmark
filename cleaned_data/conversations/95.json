The update automation also skips clusters that are in an unhealthy state or have operations currently in progress. Occasionally, IBM might disable automatic updates for a specific master fix pack, such as a patch that is only needed if a master is updated from one minor version to another. In any of these cases, you can [check the versions change log](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-changelog) for any potential impact and choose to safely use the ibmcloud ks cluster master update[command](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_cluster_update) yourself without waiting for the update automation to apply.\n\nUnlike the master, you must update your workers for each patch version.\n\nWhat happens during the master update?\n: Your master is highly available with three replica master pods.",

Check if your cluster is unsupported by reviewing the State field in the output of the `ibmcloud ks cluster ls` command or in the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service console.\n2. If your cluster is unsupported, you need to create a new cluster and deploy your apps to the new cluster. Then, you can delete the unsupported cluster.\n3. Before updating to the latest version, make sure to update deprecated clusters to a supported version that is one or two behind the current version. For example, you can update to version 1.21 or 1.22 before updating to the latest version, 1.23.\n4. If the worker nodes run a version two or more behind the master, update them to the same version as the master to avoid issues with your pods.\n5.

      "original_text": "IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service provides support for multiple versions of Kubernetes, with new versions (n) being supported along with versions up to 2 behind (n-2). Versions more than 2 behind the latest (n-3) are first deprecated and then unsupported. For a list of supported worker node operating systems by cluster version, you can refer to the Kubernetes version information in the IBM Cloud documentation.\nIf you encounter issues or need assistance, you can reach out to the IBM Cloud support team. They are available 24/7 and can be contacted through the IBM Cloud console, by phone, or via email. The support options available to you depend on your IBM Cloud account type and level. For more information, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation on getting help and support.\nIn addition to official support, IBM also offers various resources to help you troubleshoot and resolve issues on your own. These include a comprehensive knowledge base, a community forum where you can ask questions and share knowledge with other IBM Cloud users, and documentation and tutorials on using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\nIf you are unable to find a solution to your issue through these resources, you may want to consider engaging an IBM Cloud partner or consultant for additional assistance. IBM Cloud partners are certified experts who can provide consulting, migration, and management services to help you get the most out of IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. You can find a list of IBM Cloud partners on the IBM Cloud website."
