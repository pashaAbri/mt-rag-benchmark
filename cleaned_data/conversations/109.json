Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34\u00a0states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces. It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.\u00a0For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?",

In humans there are several known coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections. These coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19.\nTop of PageCoronavirus Disease 2019:\nEmergence\nCOVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market; however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases occurred.\nTransmission\nThere are three main ways that COVID-19 can spread:\n\nBy breathing in air carrying droplets or aerosol particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus when close to an infected person or in poorly ventilated spaces with infected persons\nBy having droplets and particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth \u2013 especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze\nBy touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles on them\n\nThe droplets that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is recommended by the WHO to avoid infection,1 whereas CDC recommends maintaining a physical distance of at least 1.8 meters (6ft) between persons.",

Plague can cause fever, chills, headache, and weakness, and can progress to severe pneumonia if left untreated. West Nile virus can cause fever, headache, and muscle weakness, and in severe cases, can lead to meningitis or encephalitis.\nRegarding prevention, for CWD, it is recommended to avoid feeding or watering deer and elk in areas where CWD has been found, and to properly dispose of carcasses and tissues of infected animals. For plague, it is recommended to use insect repellent, wear long pants and sleeves, and avoid contact with wild rodents and their burrows.

But global warming will have additional, far-reaching effects on the planet. Warming modifies rainfall patterns, amplifies coastal erosion, lengthens the growing season in some regions, melts ice caps and glaciers, and alters the ranges of some infectious diseases. Some of these changes are already occurring.\n\nGlobal warming will shift major climate patterns, possibly prolonging and intensifying the current drought in the U.S. Southwest. The white ring of bleached rock on the once-red cliffs that hold Lake Powell indicate the drop in water level over the past decade\u2014the result of repeated winters with low snowfall. (Photograph \u00a92006 Tigresblanco.)\n\nChanging Weather\nFor most places, global warming will result in more frequent hot days and fewer cool days, with the greatest warming occurring over land. Longer, more intense heat waves will become more common. Storms, floods, and droughts will generally be more severe as precipitation patterns change. Hurricanes may increase in intensity due to warmer ocean surface temperatures.\n\nApart from driving temperatures up, global warming is likely to cause bigger, more destructive storms, leading to an overall increase in precipitation. With some exceptions, the tropics will likely receive less rain (orange) as the planet warms, while the polar regions will receive more precipitation (green). White areas indicate that fewer than two-thirds of the climate models agreed on how precipitation will change. Stippled areas reveal where more than 90 percent of the models agreed. (\u00a92007 IPCC WG1 AR-4.)\n\nIt is impossible to pin any single unusual weather event on global warming, but emerging evidence suggests that global warming is already influencing the weather.",

Answering these questions is perhaps the most significant scientific challenge of our time.\nWhat is Global Warming?\nGlobal warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth\u2019s average surface temperature over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released as people burn fossil fuels. The global average surface temperature rose 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.1 to 1.6\u00b0 F) between 1906 and 2005, and the rate of temperature increase has nearly doubled in the last 50 years. Temperatures are certain to go up further.\n\nDespite ups and downs from year to year, global average surface temperature is rising. By the beginning of the 21st century, Earth\u2019s temperature was roughly 0.5 degrees Celsius above the long-term (1951\u20131980) average. (NASA figure adapted from Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis.)\n\nEarth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect\nEarth\u2019s temperature begins with the Sun. Roughly 30 percent of incoming sunlight is reflected back into space by bright surfaces like clouds and ice. Of the remaining 70 percent, most is absorbed by the land and ocean, and the rest is absorbed by the atmosphere. The absorbed solar energy heats our planet.\nAs the rocks, the air, and the seas warm, they radiate \u201cheat\u201d energy (thermal infrared radiation). From the surface, this energy travels into the atmosphere where much of it is absorbed by water vapor and long-lived greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.\nWhen they absorb the energy radiating from Earth\u2019s surface, microscopic water or greenhouse gas molecules turn into tiny heaters\u2014 like the bricks in a fireplace, they radiate heat even after the fire goes out. They radiate in all directions.",

Based on plausible emission scenarios, average surface temperatures could rise between 2\u00b0C and 6\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)",

Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34\u00a0states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces. It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.\u00a0For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?",

The document only mentions that it was first discovered in the United States in 1999, and it does not provide information about the discovery of the virus before that.\n|user|: animal infected diseases\n|assistant|: The document discusses several infectious diseases that can affect animals, including chronic wasting disease (CWD), plague, and West Nile virus. CWD is a slow-progressing neurological disease that affects deer, elk, and moose, and is caused by a misfolded prion protein. Plague is a severe bacterial infection that can affect humans and other mammals, and is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected flea or by handling infected animals. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause fever, headache, and muscle weakness in humans, and can also infect birds, horses, and other animals.\n|user|: are these regionally affected?\n|assistant|: Yes, these animal infectious diseases are regionally affected. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34 states and four Canadian provinces. West Nile virus has been reported in nearly 44,000 cases in the United States since 1999, with some states reporting more cases than others. Plague is most commonly found in the western United States, particularly in rural areas. Regarding the regional distribution of CWD, it was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967.  Additionally, it has been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.  \n|user|: With warming trend, West Niles virus can survive winter and more spreads in singht?\n|assistant|: Global warming could potentially affect the spread of West Nile virus.

Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34\u00a0states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces. It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.\u00a0For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?",

Plague is most commonly found in the western United States, particularly in rural areas. Regarding the regional distribution of CWD, it was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967.

Depending on the year, some states report more West Nile cases than others. Some areas of the United States also report cases of other viruses spread by mosquitoes, such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus or La Crosse Encephalitis Virus.Though anyone can get infected with West Nile virus, some people are at higher risk for infection of the brain or spinal cord. For example, people over the age of 50 are at higher risk for encephalitis (swelling of the brain).What are the symptoms of a West Nile virus infection?No Symptoms in Most PeopleMost people (70-80%) who become infected with West Nile virus do not have any symptoms.Fever in Some PeopleAbout 1 in 5 people who are infected will develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people with this type of West Nile virus recover completely, but feeling tired and weak can last for weeks to months.Severe Symptoms in a Few PeopleLess than 1% of people who are infected will develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord). The symptoms of neurologic illness can include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, seizures, or paralysis.

For current testing options, results are reported as \u201cDetected\u201d or \u201cNot Detected\u201d for CWD and other prion diseases. That means we can be certain an animal is positive for CWD if the prions are \u201cdetected\u201d but we cannot be certain the animal did not have CWD if the results are \u201cnot detected.\u201d This is one of the major issues surrounding CWD and other prion diseases and is in large part because of the attributes of the pathogen itself (the prion) and the sensitivities of the currently available tests\u00a0\nFurthermore, if you brought back only the parts allowed by \u00a0CCR Title 14, Section 712 regulations, then the samples needed to perform an official CWD test are not available. These are the retropharyngeal lymph nodes or brainstem.\nBest practice is to have your animal tested for CWD in the state you are hunting, especially if that state or region has CWD. As such we recommend doing some research before hunting out-of-state to determine 1) CWD status of the state you are hunting in and 2) how to get an animal tested for CWD in the state it was harvested.\nSome labs such as Colorado State University Diagnostic Veterinary Laboratory or the Texas A&M Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory allow hunting public to submit samples themselves for testing for a fee.\n\nHow do I declare my game at the border checkpoint, and what can I expect?",
