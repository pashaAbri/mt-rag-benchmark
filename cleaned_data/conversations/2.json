Make a family communication plan, including shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures. 3. Stay informed by visiting Ready.gov and signing up for emergency notifications from San Mateo County (SMC) Alert. 4. Get involved by signing up for a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) course and learning life-saving techniques in a CPR class. Remember, earthquakes can happen suddenly and without warning. Identifying potential hazards and planning can reduce the risk of severe injury or loss of life during an earthquake. If your home is damaged, check for gas leaks and avoid using toilets if you suspect sewage lines are damaged. Contact the gas company and a plumber if needed. In the same way, if water pipes are damaged, please contact the water company and avoid using tap water. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes. Each county prone to earthquakes has guides to help citizens before, during, and after an earthquake. Please reach out to your city hall for more information.",

What will you do when one occurs? While the potential earthquake hazards you may experience depend upon your location, everywhere in California is considered at high risk compared to the rest of the country. There are a multitude of reasons you may or may not have prepared yourself, your home, or business for the occurrence of an earthquake. But you need to take the time to do it now.Safety TipsThe Monterey Park Fire Department provides the following information to inform the general public of what to do before, during,and after an earthquake. Earthquakes strike suddenly, violently and without warning. Identifying potential hazards ahead of time and advance planning can reduce the dangers of serious injury or loss of life from an earthquake.Checking Utilities in Damaged HomesCheck for gas leaks - If you smell gas or hear blowing or hissing noises, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a neighbor's home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional.Look for electrical system damage - If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice.Check for sewage and water lines damage - If you suspect sewage lines are damaged, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber. If water pipes are damaged, contact the water company and avoid using water from the tap. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes.\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nBefore\n\nDuring\n\nAfter\n\n \n\n \n\nServices\n\nNews\n\nCalendar\n\nSubscribe\n\nContact\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nCommunity Development\n\nEmployment\n\nLibrary\n\n \n \n\nOnline Services",

Although wildfires naturally occur from lightning, human activities are the cause of most wildfires (PDF). To protect our natural resources and communities from wildfire damage, residents, visitors, and municipal jurisdictions must contribute to wildfire prevention and fire containment.\n\nWildfire terms definedWildfires are unplanned or unwanted fires burning vegetation in areas where growth is minimal or non-existent. They may also be referred to asforest fires;brush fires;grass fires;range fires;ground fires; orcrown fires.Wildland Fires include wildfires and those fires intentionally set or allowed to burn according to a recognized land management plan and are commonly referred to as prescribed fires or controlled burns.Wildland-Urban Interface Fires are wildfires that burn or threaten to burn buildings and other structures.Wildfire Mitigation is the activity of reducing the risk of wildfires and their associated property loss, forest damage, and sometimes loss of life.Wildland Fire Management is activity related to wildfire mitigation and the use of prescribed fire to accomplish ecological goals.Wildfire OccurrenceAccording to Forest Rangers Division wildfire occurrence data from 1993-2017 (PDF), wildfires in New York State are caused by the following.95% by humans.Lightning is responsible for 5%.Debris burning accounts for 33%.Incendiary fires account for 16%.Campfires cause 16%.Children are responsible for 4%.Smoking, equipment, railroads, and miscellaneous causes contribute to the remaining 25% of wildfires.Beginning in 2010, New York enacted revised open burning regulations that ban brush burning statewide from March 15 through May 15, a period when 47% of all fire department-response wildfires occur. Forest ranger data indicates that this new statewide ban resulted in 46% fewer spring wildfires caused by debris burning in upstate New York from 2010-2017 when compared to the previous 8-year average. Debris burning has been prohibited in New York City and Long Island for more than 40 years.\n\nWildland Fire Management in New YorkNew York state is 30.9 million acres in size with 18.9 million acres of non-federal forested lands. In addition, there is an undetermined amount of open-space non-forested lands with significant wildfire potential.",

We\u2019ve seen lower rainfall and lower river levels and water tables\u2014conditions that made it more likely that fires could escape their intended boundaries and burn into standing Amazon rainforest.\u201d\nIt is possible to identify some understory forest fires with the VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) sensors on the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites, but it\u2019s challenging for satellites to detect all of them because they often burn beneath dense canopy. Sensors on Landsat 8 and 9 and the Sentinel-2 satellites offer more detailed observations than VIIRS and can sometimes detect understory fires, though they pass over the Amazon basin less frequently than VIIRS.\nThe false-color image above, captured by the OLI-2 (Operational Land Imager-2) sensor on Landsat 9, shows an example of several understory fires burning in densely forested areas south of Manaus. The use of the sensor\u2019s observations in the shortwave infrared makes it easier to identify fires.\n\u201cUnderstory fires are lose-lose: they degrade the value of forests and contribute to climate change,\u201d added Morton. \u201cWe\u2019ve been working as quickly as possible to get data from the SERVIR Amazon Fire Dashboard and several satellites about the location of these fires to fire brigades on the ground to support suppression efforts as quickly as possible.

While we can not guarantee that plastic sheeting over air vents will stop all biological, chemical, or radiological agents, it will add to the barrier of protection for your safety.\t\n\n5.\nDo I need a safe room? What is a safe room?\n\r\nA safe room, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is a room - preferably below ground - in which people can take shelter from a tornado. If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat. However, do not confuse a safe room used for protection from windstorms with a room selected for shelter-in-place. They are technically different, although they serve a similar purpose. If a safe room for windstorms is above ground level and has no windows, it can also be an ideal location in which to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n6.\nHow much time do I have to get to my designated room to shelter-in-place once I hear of an attack?\n\r\nThe situation will vary, depending on the nature of the event. It is best to take immediate protective action as soon as you think there is a local emergency, or if you hear on the radio or television that you need to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n7.\nDo I need to put towels under my door? Should they be wet?\n\r\nWet towels under a door are used in cases when you are in a room from which you can not escape and a fire is on the other side. That is not the same thing as what needs to be done when you shelter-in-place. See the instructions on shelter-in-place on the Red Cross website.\t\n\n8.\nIf I seal off my rooms and vents, how will I breathe? How long should I anticipate being in the room in which I am sheltering-in-place?",

However, if the safe room is located below ground, it may not be suitable for protection during a weapons of mass destruction event. The Red Cross recommends safe rooms for areas prone to tornadoes. It's important not to confuse safe rooms for tornadoes with shelter-in-place rooms. An above-ground safe room with no windows can also be used as a shelter-in-place location. It's important to note that a safe room used for protection from windstorms is different from a room selected for shelter-in-place, although they serve a similar purpose. If an above-ground safe room for windstorms has no windows, it can also be an ideal location for sheltering-in-place.\n|user|: What items should I keep?\n|assistant|: Being prepared to take care of yourself during a disaster is crucial. This means having enough food, water, and other supplies to last at least three days if stores are closed and roads are impassable due to a flood or winter storm. While local officials and relief workers will be available after a disaster, they may only be able to reach some people after a disaster. You could receive help within hours, but it may take days. It's important to note that the recommendation to have at least three days' worth of disaster supplies differs from the advice to shelter in place, which may involve using duct tape and plastic sheeting during an emergency. The Red Cross advises people to have these supplies on hand if needed.\n|user|: Is it the same for earthquakes?\n|assistant|: Each disaster has its characteristics, but it's important to plan and prepare today for you and your family to recover from an emergency tomorrow. Here are some steps you can take: 1. Get an Emergency Supplies kit lasting up to three days per family member, and remember supplies for your pets. 2. Make a family communication plan, including shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures. 3. Stay informed by visiting Ready.gov and signing up for emergency notifications from San Mateo County (SMC) Alert. 4. Get involved by signing up for a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) course and learning life-saving techniques in a CPR class. Remember, earthquakes can happen suddenly and without warning. Identifying potential hazards and planning can reduce the risk of severe injury or loss of life during an earthquake. If your home is damaged, check for gas leaks and avoid using toilets if you suspect sewage lines are damaged. Contact the gas company and a plumber if needed. In the same way, if water pipes are damaged, please contact the water company and avoid using tap water. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes. Each county prone to earthquakes has guides to help citizens before, during, and after an earthquake. Please reach out to your city hall for more information.\n|user|: Which state has more wildfires?\n|assistant|: The documents do not specifically mention California, but it is known that the 2018 wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive on record in the state. The 2020 California wildfire season saw record-setting wildfires burn across the state, with nearly 10,000 fires burning over 4.2 million acres by the end of the year. This accounted for more than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season in California's modern history. The August Complex fire, part of the 2020 wildfire year, has been described as the first \"gigafire\" due to the area burned exceeding 1 million acres. This fire spread across seven counties and was larger than the state of Rhode Island.\n|user|: What causes wildfires?\n|assistant|: Although wildfires occur naturally from lightning, human activities cause most wildfires. Drought fuels wildfires, as happened in the Amazon, caused by the El Ni\u00f1o system.\n|user|: Why doesn't the government prevent people from living in areas prone to flooding?"

      "original_text": "There are several reasons why governments may not prevent people from living in areas prone to flooding. Firstly, many areas that are prone to flooding are also economically valuable for agriculture, industry, or housing. Secondly, preventing development in flood-prone areas can be politically challenging, as it may require eminent domain proceedings or significant financial incentives to relocate residents. Thirdly, some people may choose to live in flood-prone areas despite the risks, due to factors such as affordability or proximity to work or family. Finally, while governments can implement policies to mitigate the risks of flooding, such as building levees or requiring developers to elevate buildings, they cannot completely eliminate the risk of flooding. Therefore, it is important for individuals to understand the risks associated with living in flood-prone areas and to take appropriate precautions, such as purchasing flood insurance and having a plan for evacuation or sheltering in place."

Flood effects can be local, impacting a neighborhood or community, or very large, affecting entire river basins and multiple states.\nHowever, all floods are not alike. Some floods develop slowly, sometimes over a period of days. But flash floods can develop quickly, sometimes in just a few minutes and without any visible signs of rain. Flash floods often have a dangerous wall of roaring water that carries rocks, mud, and other debris and can sweep away most things in its path. Overland flooding occurs outside a defined river or stream, such as when a levee is breached, but still can be destructive. Flooding can also occur when a dam breaks, producing effects similar to flash floods.\nBe aware of flood hazards no matter where you live, but especially if you live in a low-lying area, near water or downstream from a dam. Even very small streams, gullies, creeks, culverts, dry streambeds, or low-lying ground that appear harmless in dry weather can flood. Every state is at risk from this hazard.\nWhat is the flood risk where I live?\nHow can I protect myself from a flood?\n\nKnow your flood terms\nWhat to do before a flood\nWhat to do during a flood\nWhat to do after a flood\n\nLast Modified: Friday, 13-Jun-2008 13:32:33 EDT\n\nFast Facts\nLearn about flood risk\u00a0and flood insurance\nSignificant Flood Events\nFlood Health Risks\n\nSolutions\n\nRepair Flood Damage\nBuy Flood Insurance\n\nOnline Tools\n\nMap Service Center\n\nRelated Topics\n\nFlood Photos\nFloodplain Management\nFlood Hazard Mapping\n\nHome\nContact Us\nPrivacy Policy\nImportant Notices\nFOIA\nNo FEAR Act Data\nUSA.gov\nDHS\n\nFEMA 500 C Street SW, Washington, D.C. 20472Disaster Assistance: (800) 621-FEMA, TTY (800) 462-7585\n\n \n\n",

Global warming can be influenced by natural causes such as volcanic activity and changes in Earth's orbit over millions of years. However, these natural factors cannot explain the recent rapid warming. Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns, including physical effects such as heat waves, sea level rise, heavy rainfall, floods, and droughts. While some climate change is naturally occurring, today's climate changes rapidly due to human activities such as greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and wetland loss. These human activities are causing the Earth's average temperature to increase faster than it would naturally. The Greenhouse Effect, Greenhouse Gases, and Global Warming are all interconnected in this process.",

          "text": "Climate Change - NYSDEC\nClimate, however, refers to regional or global average patterns of temperature, humidity, and precipitation over longer time periods such as seasons, years, decades, or centuries. Climate is influenced by the movement of heat and moisture by air and ocean currents, which can affect the temperatures, precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, surface water levels, groundwater levels, and even storm events of a particular region.Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that define the Earth's global, regional and local climates. Often when we think of climate change, we think of the physical effects of climate change such as heatwaves, sea level rise, and heavy rainfall, and the impacts on communities and the environment, such as floods and droughts.Some climate change is influenced by naturally occurring changes in the Earth's temperature. For at least the last million years, the Earth has experienced natural cycles of cooling and warming, taking the Earth into ice ages and warming it up again. Each of these naturally-occurring cycles has taken approximately 100,000 years to complete.However, today's climate is changing much more rapidly because of greenhouse gas emissions released from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, wetland loss, and other human activities that are causing the Earth's average temperature to heat up much faster than it would naturally.The Greenhouse Effect, Greenhouse Gases, and Global Warming\n\n \n\nEnergy from the sun, or solar radiation, travels through space and enters the Earth's atmosphere, which forms a kind of warm blanket around the Earth. Some solar radiation remains trapped in the atmosphere under this blanket and is absorbed by land, air, and surface waters, while some solar radiation is reflected by land, ice, or clouds and escapes back out into space. When the Earth reflects the same amount of energy as it absorbs, the balance keeps the planet's average temperature fairly stable. This is called the greenhouse effect, and is essential for sustaining life on Earth. The revolution of the Earth around the sun and the tilt of the Earth on its axis create variation in the intensity of solar radiation received by different sections of the planet and drive naturally occurring cycles of planetary cooling and warming. This variation over time is what sends the Earth into ice ages and then into shorter warming periods between these ice ages.",

This is called the greenhouse effect, and is essential for sustaining life on Earth.

This variation over time is what sends the Earth into ice ages and then into shorter warming periods between these ice ages. However, these natural climate cycles can be disrupted by conditions that cause an excessive amount of solar radiation to get trapped in the Earth's atmosphere and throw off the natural balance.Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N20), that are naturally present in the Earth's atmosphere in small amounts and help form the atmospheric blanket at the ideal thickness. CO2 is vital for plants to carry out photosynthesis and produce oxygen for humans and animals to breathe. When excess GHGs are generated by human activities and accumulate in the atmosphere, they increase the thickness of the atmospheric blanket, trapping solar radiation in the Earth's atmosphere. GHGs absorb and transmit that radiation back to Earth as heat. The more GHGs accumulate in the atmosphere, the thicker the blanket becomes, trapping more heat inside and creating global warming.Global warming causes the Earth's land and oceans to absorb heat energy and warm more quickly than would happen naturally. Global warming is made worse by the melting of polar ice and glaciers. Because of the albedo effect, light-colored snow and ice act as mirrors to reflect solar radiation back out into space. As ice sheets and glaciers melt with increased global warming, reducing the amount of ice and snow covering, less of the solar radiation is reflected and more is absorbed into the darker ocean waters, creating a vicious cycle that warms the planet even more and melts even more polar ice and glaciers.Global warming has been rapidly accelerating in recent decades due to excess emissions of GHGs from human activities, especially burning of fossil fuels and deforestation.",
