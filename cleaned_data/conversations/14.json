The findings of such investigations increased fear among the Muslim masses of future Hindu domination . The view that Muslims would be unfairly treated in an independent India dominated by the Congress was now a part of the public discourse of Muslims . With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , the viceroy , Lord Linlithgow , declared war on India 's behalf without consulting Indian leaders , leading the Congress provincial ministries to resign in protest . The Muslim League , which functioned under state patronage , in contrast , organized `` Deliverance Day '' , celebrations ( from Congress dominance ) and supported Britain in the war effort . When Linlithgow , met with nationalist leaders , he gave the same status to Jinnah as he did to Gandhi , and a month later described the Congress as a `` Hindu organization . ''",

Another opposition leader outside of these groups was Subhas Chandra Bose, who was in exile and supporting the Axis Powers. However, the only notable support for the movement came from the Americans, as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands."

The actual words for mother in Tulu is appe pronounced IPA : ( ape ) and the word for father in Tulu is amme pronounced IPA : ( am\u00e6 ) . Note that the usage of these words is at odds with the usage pattern in other languages ( similar to Georgian in that sense ) . In Telugu , `` Thalli '' and `` Thandri '' are used for mother and father in formal Telugu . Amma and nana are used for mother and father for the informal way . Notice how nana refers to maternal grandfather in Hindi , and how that differs from its Telugu meaning . `` Nayana '' is also used for father in informal Telugu in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana of India . In Malayalam , `` Amma '' is used for mother . Hindus use `` Achan '' ( \u0d05\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1b\u0d7b ) for father and Christians use `` Appan '' . `` Appan '' was also previously used by matriarchal Hindu castes to denote the mother 's husband who may or may not be the biological father . The word `` Achan '' is a transformed Malayalam equivalent of the Sanskrit `` Arya '' for `` Sir / Master '' ( Arya - ajja - > ayya ) . `` Achan '' gained almost universal acceptance as the word for father among most Hindus during the 20th century . However , some families and communities also use ' appa ' etc. at least within their circles . The Malayali Christian communities often use a different set of words for father such as chaachchan ( \u0d1a\u0d3e\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d7b ) , appachan ( \u0d05\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d7b ) etc . The Muslim communities use vaappa ( \u0d35\u0d3e\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a ) , vaappachchi ( \u0d35\u0d3e\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d3f ) , uppa ( \u0d09\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a ) etc . In Tamil , `` Thai '' and `` Thanthai '' are the formal Tamil words for mother and father ; informally Amma and Appa are much more common words for mother and father respectively . In the Kannada language , `` Thaai '' for mother and `` Thande '' for father are used formally . But to address them informally Kannadigas use amma or abbe for mother and appa for father .",

The British , already alarmed by the advance of the Japanese army to the India - Burma border , responded by imprisoning Gandhi . All the members of the Party 's Working Committee ( national leadership ) were imprisoned as well . Due to the arrest of major leaders , a young and until then relatively unknown Aruna Asaf Ali presided over the AICC session on 9 August and hoisted the flag ; later the Congress party was banned . These actions only created sympathy for the cause among the population . Despite lack of direct leadership , large protests and demonstrations were held all over the country . Workers remained absent en masse and strikes were called . Not all demonstrations were peaceful , at some places bombs exploded , government buildings were set on fire , electricity was cut and transport and communication lines were severed . Play",

The economy was then characterised by extensive regulation , protectionism , public ownership of large monopolies , pervasive corruption and slow growth . Since 1991 , continuing economic liberalisation has moved the country towards a market - based economy . By 2008 , India had established itself as one of the world 's faster - growing economies .",

These reforms helped India become one of the fastest-growing major economies and transformed it into a newly industrialized country. However, it still faces challenges such as poverty, corruption, malnutrition, and inadequate public healthcare."
