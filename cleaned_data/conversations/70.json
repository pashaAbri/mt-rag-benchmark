The document focuses on enhancing your chatbot's functionality by integrating it with IBM Watson Discovery for improved search and answer capabilities. To do this, you should create a Conversational Search project and add a collection that connects to an external data source or contains uploaded files.\n|user|: Does he understand my emotions?\n|assistant|: Yes, Watson Assistant has the capability to understand human emotions to some extent. However, this is not through some mystical communion with cosmic energy, but through features like Emotion Analysis in certain IBM Watson products.  It can evaluates the overall emotional tone like joy, disgust, anger, fear, and sadness in a given text. It calculates a score for each emotion on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, and if the score of any emotion is 0.5 or higher, it is considered detected, currently though in English only.

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Web chat overview \n\nLearn more about the web chat that you can add to your company website.\n\nWeb chat is a code snippet that you can immediately embed in your website.\n\nWhen you build a custom user interface for your assistant, you spend a lot of time and effort writing code to solve typical UI problems. For example, you must keep up with browser support changes, manage scrolling behavior, validate input, and design the layout and styling. The time you spend designing and maintaing a UI can be better spent building a quality assistant instead. When you use the web chat integration, you can rely on us to manage the user interface, so you can focus on designing conversational exchanges that address the unique business needs of your customers. Cutting-edge functionality from IBM Design and Research is incorporated into the web chat to deliver an exceptional user experience.\n\nFor more information about how to deploy the web chat, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\n\n\n Browser support \n\nThe web chat supports a variety of devices and platforms. As a general rule, if the last two versions of a browser account for more than 1% of all desktop or mobile traffic, the web chat supports that browser.\n\nThe following list specifies the minimum required browser software for the web chat (including the two most recent versions, except as noted):\n\n\n\n* Google Chrome\n* Apple Safari\n* Mobile Safari\n* Chrome for Android\n* Microsoft Edge (Chromium and non-Chromium)\n* Mozilla Firefox\n* Firefox ESR (most recent ESR only)\n* Opera\n* Samsung Mobile Browser\n* UC Browser for Android\n* Mobile Firefox\n\n\n\nFor optimal results when rendering the web chat on mobile devices, the <head> element of your web page must include the following metadata element:\n\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n Global audience support",
