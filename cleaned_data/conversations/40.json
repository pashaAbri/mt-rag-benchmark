          "text": "Toby Flenderson\nIn `` Night Out , '' Pam thinks that a joke that Toby told was funny , and he gets really excited and touches her awkwardly on the leg . She did not appear to be angered at this . After an awkward silence , Toby announces his move to Costa Rica . In `` Goodbye , Toby '' Pam gives to Toby an office picture of the staff that excludes her ( because she took the picture herself ) for when he leaves for Costa Rica . Toby , unsatisfied by the lack of her presence , shouts at the office staff asking for a camera ( possibly the loudest he 's ever spoken ) . When no one responds , he runs off for an extended amount of time just to find a camera to have a picture of her and him together . Pam also helps Toby take revenge against Michael in this episode after his insulting farewell gift is exposed during a meeting and she gets him to unwillingly give up his watch to Toby , which he does ( Pam potentially may have disclosed Michael 's abuse of Toby if he did n't do what she said ) . At the end of the episode , Pam comments ( though not to Toby ) that she always thought he was kind of cute and that she will miss him a lot . In `` Niagara '' Toby appears to still have feelings for Pam and is happy when they run out on their wedding . He is later disappointed when the wedding is called back on but is seen smiling and clapping after they 're married and run down the aisle . During `` Roy 's Wedding '' , while Jim and Pam are trying to find out if there 's anything they do n't know about each other , Toby correctly answers facts about Pam . Everyone notices him , and Toby , clearly embarrassed , attempts to cover it up . There have been a few occasions when Pam has mistreated Toby somewhat such as hanging up on him on the phone after Toby offered his help and notably in `` Paper Airplane '' after hitting him in the eye with a paper airplane and getting angry at him for crossing ( to which Toby apologizes ) . Pam in response does not apologize and simply asks whether she is still in the contest despite injuring and temporally blinding Toby . In the series finale , while dancing with Pam , Toby began sobbing . Pam questions Toby with `` Is it me ? Is it Nellie ? '' Toby shakes his head , and responds with `` It 's everything . '' Pam then hugs Toby as he weeps .",

He has reached out to Michael several times despite Michael 's continued abuse . However , he gets along with the rest of the staff and even attends Jim 's barbecue party , playing video games while Michael sings karaoke . When Dwight approached Michael about missing a gift bag during `` A Benihana Christmas , '' Michael immediately suggested stealing it from Toby , much to Toby 's later chagrin , as all the office staff had new robes except for him ( Pam later gave her robe to Toby , and this increased Toby 's unrequited crush on her ) . In addition Michael on numerous occasions attempts to blame Toby for problems that are clearly his own fault such as in `` The Merger '' in which he questions Tony Gardner if the reason he is quitting is because of Toby , though Tony says Toby was in fact kind and helpful and it 's Michael 's management that is the reason . This occurs again notably in `` Classy Christmas '' where Michael himself vandalizes Holly 's Woody doll ( A gift from her boyfriend ) and tries to convince her Toby did it , though Toby fights back , denies it and says the vandalism is something Michael would do . This is evidence that Michael uses Toby as an excuse to hide from the consequences of his own actions .",

'' Daniels also said all the questions would be answered , such as who was behind the documentary , and why they had been filming it for so long , as well as the reveal of the Scranton Strangler . A central point during the season was the romance between Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) and Pete Miller ( Jake Lacy ) . According to Michael Ausiello of TVLine , the nature of their relationship was heavily debated by the writers and producers ; he noted that `` the triangle ( between Andy , Erin , and Pete ) has stirred up a number of debates in the writers room , which tells me even they do n't know at this point which guy Erin will choose . '' Daniels consulted with Kemper and asked for her input , as he felt she had the best understanding of Erin 's characterization . Angela",

Based on seven critiques , review aggregation website Metacritic gave the ninth season of the show a 64 out of 100 rating , which denotes `` generally favorable reviews '' . Entertainment website Holy Moly named the series one of the best shows during the 2012 -- 13 season , writing that `` this final season of The Office has been great '' largely due to the fact that `` every single relationship in the show rings true with the audience . '' Michael Tedder of Vulture commented that he was `` willing to call it the fourth best season of the show overall , which is by no means faint praise . '' He explained that this was largely due to the fact that the `` final season was a chance to see how everyone else would end up '' . Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club wrote that `` the tension between Jim and Pam in the final season ended up being highly controversial for a number of reasons ... but it also provided the most hopeful moments of the series ' final stretch '' ( although he did note that it was clear that the writers had `` blatantly '' set up the drama ) . He concluded that the finale was able to successfully return the series `` to what had always been its heart -- to have true fulfillment '' . Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the season an 8.5 out of 10 , denoting a `` great '' year . She felt that the character growth in the final few episodes was particularly well executed , and the last stretch of the season helped raise it after a rocky start ; ultimately , she felt that the writers were able to craft the proper ending for the show . She was , however , critical of Andy 's characterization , noting that he was merely used as a plot device when convenient . Many critics argued that the season was an improvement , in both writing and humor , over the previous season .",

The season premiere , `` New Guys '' received a 2.1 / 6 percent share in the Nielsen ratings among viewers aged 18 to 49 , meaning that 2.1 percent of viewers aged 18 to 49 watched the episode , and 6 percent of viewers watching television at the time watched the episode . The episode was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and became the lowest - rated season premiere for the series . In addition , it marked a 46 percent drop in viewership from the season eight premiere `` The List '' . For the first sixteen episodes , the series was able to maintain roughly 4 million viewers . However , starting with the seventeenth episode `` The Farm '' , ratings began to drop below this threshold . The series hit an all - time low with the twentieth episode , `` Paper Airplane '' , which was viewed by only 3.25 million viewers , and received a 1.7 rating / 5 percent share . The series finale was viewed by 5.69 million viewers and received a 3.0 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This made it the highest - rated episode of the season ; it also marked an increase in the previous season finale , which garnered only 4.49 million viewers . `` Finale '' was the most watched episode of The Office since the eighth season episode `` Pool Party '' , but ranked as the third - least watched finale of the series , following the eighth - and first - season finales . Although in its ninth season , The Office no longer was NBC 's highest - rated scripted comedy series -- it was surpassed by Go On -- it often ranked as the highest - rated scripted NBC series on Thursday nights . Rainn Wilson argued that the show 's lower ratings were a combination of the overall trend in lower television ratings in 2012 , as well as the fact that `` NBC did n't promote ( the series ) one bit '' . NBC increased their usual ad - price by 200 percent for the finale , asking for $400,000 per commercial . This was largely due to the anticipated increase in viewership that the finale would bring .",

The season premiere , `` New Guys '' received a 2.1 / 6 percent share in the Nielsen ratings among viewers aged 18 to 49 , meaning that 2.1 percent of viewers aged 18 to 49 watched the episode , and 6 percent of viewers watching television at the time watched the episode . The episode was viewed by 4.28 million viewers and became the lowest - rated season premiere for the series . In addition , it marked a 46 percent drop in viewership from the season eight premiere `` The List '' . For the first sixteen episodes , the series was able to maintain roughly 4 million viewers . However , starting with the seventeenth episode `` The Farm '' , ratings began to drop below this threshold . The series hit an all - time low with the twentieth episode , `` Paper Airplane '' , which was viewed by only 3.25 million viewers , and received a 1.7 rating / 5 percent share . The series finale was viewed by 5.69 million viewers and received a 3.0 rating among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 . This made it the highest - rated episode of the season ; it also marked an increase in the previous season finale , which garnered only 4.49 million viewers . `` Finale '' was the most watched episode of The Office since the eighth season episode `` Pool Party '' , but ranked as the third - least watched finale of the series , following the eighth - and first - season finales . Although in its ninth season , The Office no longer was NBC 's highest - rated scripted comedy series -- it was surpassed by Go On -- it often ranked as the highest - rated scripted NBC series on Thursday nights . Rainn Wilson argued that the show 's lower ratings were a combination of the overall trend in lower television ratings in 2012 , as well as the fact that `` NBC did n't promote ( the series ) one bit '' . NBC increased their usual ad - price by 200 percent for the finale , asking for $400,000 per commercial . This was largely due to the anticipated increase in viewership that the finale would bring .",

Users of Apple TV can rent or buy movies and TV shows from the iTunes Store , or stream video from a variety of services found in the tvOS App Store such as Netflix , Amazon Prime Video , Hulu , YouTube , Vimeo , HBO Now , Showtime , Sling TV , and DirecTV Now . Users can stream live and on - demand content from apps that support login through a cable provider by way of one universal app called TV . TV unifies all content into one central application that allows the user to watch whatever they want from any source while providing recommendations . These include ABC , NBC , CBS , NBA , NFL , NHL , WatchESPN , History Channel , Food Network , CNN , Fox News , HGTV , Disney , National Geographic , and many others . The upcoming single - sign on feature in tvOS 10.1 will allow users to log in to all of these apps at once , bypassing the need to authenticate each individually . Music and Podcasts Streaming Users can access their music and podcasts libraries that they purchased in iTunes through iCloud through the Music and Podcasts apps , respectively . In addition , users can also subscribe to music streaming services such as Apple Music , Pandora , Qello , and Vevo and access content that way . Photos The built in Photos app syncs user photos from iCloud Photo Library and displays them on TV . In addition , users can download third - party apps like Adobe Lightroom to view , edit and share them . Apps and Games With the fourth generation Apple TV and later , users can download apps and games from the tvOS App Store . This app store is similar to the one found on the Apple iPhone and iPad . Apps can now be ported from iOS easily by developers since tvOS and iOS share a common codebase and kernel . Examples include the Papa John 's Pizza app which allows for users to order pizza right from Apple TV and Zillow which allows users to search for homes right on their TV . Games use the Accelerometer and Gyroscope along with the touchpad found on the Siri Remote for control . External Bluetooth Game controllers : ( such as the SteelSeries Nimbus , or the HORIPAD ULTIMATE Wireless Gaming Controller ) can also be paired .",
