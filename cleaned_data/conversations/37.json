However a loan with a cosigner can bring a lot problems. In the first scenario, if the loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner, then both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially, this might decrease related credit scores slightly due to a hard pull, new account with zero history, and increased debt. However, over time, it can have a positive effect on both people's credit ratings if the loan is paid properly. Conversely, if the loan is not paid properly, it will negatively affect both people's credit. In the second scenario, if the loan company only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the cosigner), leaving the other as just a backup, it will have no effect on the borrower's credit. In the third scenario, if the loan company doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, there will be no direct impact on the borrower's credit. However, if the loan goes into collections and is reported as such, it would negatively affect the borrower's credit.

By co-signing, you're saying that you think you know better than the professionals. If / when the borrower defaults, the lender won't pursue them for the loan if you can pay it.  You're just as responsible for the loan payments as the original borrower, and given that you were a useful co-signer, probably much more likely to be able to come up with the money.  The lender has no reason to go after the original borrower, and won't.  If you can't pay, the lender comes after both of you. To put it another way:  Don't think of cosigning as helping them get a loan.  Think of it as taking out a loan and re-loaning it to them.",

Again you know this isn't someone who is going to mismanage their money and walk away from the payments and leave you holding the bag. If you would give the person the money anyway (say, a car for your newly graduated child) then cosigning instead gives them more of a sense of accomplishment, since they paid for it, and gives them a great credit rating too. If you would not give the person the entire loan amount, but would make their payments for many months or even a year (say, your brother's mortgage for the house where he lives with a sick wife and 3 small children), then cosigning is only making official what you would have done anyway. Arrange with the borrower that if they can't make their payments any more, you will backstop them AND the item (car, house, whatever) is going up for sale to cover your losses. If you don't think you could enforce that just from the strength of the relationship, reconsider co-signing. Then sign what you need to sign and step away from it. It's their loan, not yours. You want them to pay it and to manage it and to leave you out of it until it's all paid off and they thank you for your help. If things go south, you will have to pay, and it may take a while for you to sell the item or otherwise stop the paying, so you do need to be very confident that the borrower is going to make every single payment on time. My point is just that you can have that confidence, based on personal knowledge of character, employment situation, savings and other resources, in a way that a lender really cannot.",

I am writing this like it is easy but it really requires that asset is still in good condition, that cosigner can get to the asset, and that the \"\"friend\"\" still is around and trusts cosigner. I have seen more than a few cosigners promise to deliver and come up short and couple conspiring with the \"\"friend\"\". I basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you haven't provided enough info to give perfect advice. Seeking a lawyer is a joke. Going after a fleeing party could eat up 40-50 billable hours. It isn't like you are suing a business or something. The lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan - and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have bled you dry - just really unsound advice. For the most part I would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100% of the details. The other part is cosigning the loan. Why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend? Most parents won't cosign a loan for their own kids. And if you are cosigning a loan, you write up a simple contract and make the non-payment penalties extremely costly for your friend.

This isn't the typical way of doing business for most places, but some businesses still operate this way, including some places that advertise how doing business with them (paying them grossly inflated interest rates) will \"\"help build your credit\"\". Most advertising fraud goes unpunished. Note: Under all of the above scenarios, the loan can only effect the credit rating attached to the bureau it is reported to. If the loan is reported to Equifax, it will not help you with a TransUnion or Experian rating at all. Some loans report to multiple credit bureaus, but many don't bother, and credit bureaus don't automatically copy each other. It's important to remember that there isn't so much a thing as a singular \"\"consumer credit rating\"\", as there are \"\"consumer credit ratings\"\" - 3 of them, for most purposes, and they can vary widely depending on your reported histories. Also, if it is only a short-term loan of 3-6 months then it is unlikely to have a powerful impact on anyone's credit rating. Credit scores are formulas calibrated to care about long-term behavior, where 3 years of perfect credit history is still considered a short period of time and you will be deemed to have a significant risk of default without more data. So don't expect to qualify for a prime-rate mortgage because of a car loan that was paid off in a few months; it might be enough to give you a score if you don't have one, but don't expect much more. As always, please remember that taking out a loan just to improve credit is almost always a terrible idea.",

See if they also say that your credit is negatively impacted by so many loans, even though the balances are small. If all three credit reporting companies are in consensus about negative effecting your credit, then it is true. If that IS the case, check with your subsidized loan lender about consolidation. If the unsubsidized loans are from the same lender, ask them too. If they're from different lenders, you might want to ask at your bank about getting a debt consolidation loan. You might be able to save money by refinancing (consolidating) the unsubsidized student loans as one loan, maybe even ALL the loans as one loan, particularly if you bank at a credit union.",

To put it another way:  Don't think of cosigning as helping them get a loan.  Think of it as taking out a loan and re-loaning it to them.",

However a loan with a cosigner can bring a lot problems. In the first scenario, if the loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner, then both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially, this might decrease related credit scores slightly due to a hard pull, new account with zero history, and increased debt. However, over time, it can have a positive effect on both people's credit ratings if the loan is paid properly. Conversely, if the loan is not paid properly, it will negatively affect both people's credit. In the second scenario, if the loan company only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the cosigner), leaving the other as just a backup, it will have no effect on the borrower's credit. In the third scenario, if the loan company doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, there will be no direct impact on the borrower's credit. However, if the loan goes into collections and is reported as such, it would negatively affect the borrower's credit. Nevertheless a cosigner will make sure you are going to make every single payment on time because otherwise he will be responsible to pay it  .                                    \n|user|: I see, that means if the person does not ot pay his/her loand, the cosigner will be responsability to do it right and how does this work?\n|assistant|: Yes, that's right. The co-signer is responsible for the loan just as much as borrower is. In fact if the borrower does not pay, the co-signer is liable for making the payments. When you co-sign a loan, you are essentially saying \"\"I will pay this loan if the other person can't.\"\"\" The cos-signer is 100% liable if for any reason you can't or won't pay. Also this shows up on a credit report just like it's your debt. This limits the amount you can borrow for any reason.\n|user|: It is better never be a co-signer."

I basically think most of the advice you have gotten so far is crap and you haven't provided enough info to give perfect advice. Seeking a lawyer is a joke. Going after a fleeing party could eat up 40-50 billable hours. It isn't like you are suing a business or something. The lawyer could cost as much as repaying the loan - and most lawyers will act like it is a snap of their fingers until they have bled you dry - just really unsound advice. For the most part I would suggest talking to the bank and defaulting but again need 100% of the details. The other part is cosigning the loan. Why the hell would you cosign a loan for a friend? Most parents won't cosign a loan for their own kids. And if you are cosigning a loan, you write up a simple contract and make the non-payment penalties extremely costly for your friend. I have seen simple contracts that include 30% interests rates that were upheld by courts.\"",

It is among other reasons why you should never cosign a loan for someone unless you are 100% prepared to pay the loan on their behalf. Unfortunately, the main \"\"benefit\"\" to cosigning a loan is to the bank - they don't care who makes payments, only that someone does. It is not in their interest to educate purchasers who can easily get themselves into the situation you are in. What your options are depends a fair bit on the type of loan it is. The biggest problem is that normally as cosigner you cannot force your friend to do anything. If it is for a car, your best bet is to convince them to sell the car and hopefully recoup more than the cost of the loan. Many workplaces have some sort of free service to provide counseling/guidance on this sort of thing. Look into your employee benefits as you may have some free services there. You can sue your friend in small claims court, but keep in mind: It also depends on how big the loan is relative to your income. While it might feel good to sue your friend in small claims court, if it's for $500 it probably isn't worthwhile - but if your friend just stopped paying off their $30k vehicle assuming you will pay for it, even though they can pay for it themselves?\"",

The bank doesn't care why he didn't, they just want their money on time. Getting him to repay you for covering this is strictly between the two of you, and unless you signed paperwork at the time establishing a contract other than the promise to cover his loan this becomes Extremely Messy. First step is to make the payments so the loan doesn't continue acquiring fees and hurting your credit rating, and keep it from falling behind again. Then you have to convince him to repay the money you have effectively given him. Depending on your relationship, and financial situations, you may decide to carry him for a while and trust that he'll pay you back when he can, or sic a lawyer on him. You need to make that decision, recognizing that it may be a matter of how much family drama you are willing to tolerate.",

Think about it, if the bank is asking for a co-signer its because they are not very confident that the applicant is going to be paying back the loan. So why would you then step up and say I'll pay back the loan if they don't, make me a co-signer please. Here is a list of things that people never think about when they cosign a loan for somebody.  Now if you absolutely must co-sign a loan here is how I would do it. I, the co-signer would be the one who makes the payments to ensure that the loan was paid on time and I would be the one collecting the payment from the person who is getting the loan. Its a very simple way of preventing some of the worst situations that can arise and you should be willing to make the payments anyway after all thats what it means to cosign a loan. Your just turning things around and paying the loan upfront instead of paying after the applicant defaults and ruins every ones credit.

As this article notes: Generally, co-signing refers to financing, not ownership. If the primary accountholder fails to make payments on the loan or the retail installment sales contract (a type of auto financing dealers sell), the co-signer is responsible for those payments, or their credit will suffer. Even if the co-signer makes the payments, they\u2019re still not the owner if their name isn\u2019t on the title. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) notes: If you co-sign a loan, you are legally obligated to repay the loan in full. Co-signing a loan does not mean serving as a character reference for someone else. When you co-sign, you promise to pay the loan yourself. It means that you risk having to repay any missed payments immediately. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the creditor can use the same collection methods against you that can be used against the borrower such as demanding that you repay the entire loan yourself, suing you, and garnishing your wages or bank accounts after a judgment. Your credit score(s) may be impacted by any late payments or defaults. Co-signing an auto loan does not mean you have any right to the vehicle, it just means that you have agreed to become obligated to repay the amount of the loan. So make sure you can afford to pay this debt if the borrower cannot. Per this article and this loan.com article, options to remove your name from co-signing include: If you're name isn't on the title, you'll have to convince your ex-boyfriend and the bank to have you removed as the co-signer, but from your brief description above, it doesn't seem that your ex is going to be cooperative. Unfortunately, as the co-signer and guarantor of the loan, you're legally responsible for making the payments if he doesn't. Not making the payments could ruin your credit as well. One final option to consider is bankruptcy.",

Your credit rating is the way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts, not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full.  The fact that you make your payments on time will definitely not lower your credit rating. While the banks are not making as much money on you as they would if you carried a balance, they are also not spending a lot of money on you, nor losing a lot of money on people like you failing to repay debts.  The transactions charged to the retailers cover the costs of operating your card and then a little bit.  That is enough to make you worth keeping as a customer.  They are happy with your arrangement. The formula for credit rating computation is proprietary, but we know what the factors are overall.  Making payments on time consistently is a positive, not a negative factor.  However, they do look at the number of cards and overall mix of cards and other types of debt.  For example, if you have a very large amount of credit capacity in your cards and no mortgage, that could possibly be a negative.  If you have opened some of those accounts recently, it could be a negative.  If you have a larger number credit cards than they think is good, that could be a negative. There are other things as well that could be bringing your score down.  Probably worth it to take a look. If you want to get an idea of what factors are adding positively and negatively to your credit score, I'd encourage you to visit CreditKarma.com, Quizzle.com, or another source intended to help you understand and improve your credit rating.",

It is supplemented by your age, time at current residence, time at previous residences, time at your job, etc. A person with zero debt history can still have a decent score - provided they are well established, a little older and have a good job.  The top scores are reserved for those that manage what creditors consider an \"\"appropriate\"\" amount of debt and are well established.  In other words, you're good with money and likely have long term roots in the community.  After all, creditors don't normally like being the first one you try out... Being young and having recently moved you are basically a \"\"flight risk\"\".  Meaning someone who is more likely to just pick up and move when the debt becomes too much. So, you have a couple options.  The first is to simply wait.  Keep going to work, keep living where you are, etc.  As you establish yourself you become less of a risk.   The second is to start incurring debt.  Personally, I am not a fan of this one.  Some people do well by getting a small credit card, using some portion of it each month and paying it off immediately.  Others don't know how to control that very well and end up having a few months where they roll balances over etc which becomes a trap that costs them far more than before. If I were in your position, I'd likely do one of two things.  Either buy the phone outright and sign up for a regular mobile plan OR take the cheaper phone for a couple years.\"",

Generally, consumers with higher credit scores are granted lower interest rates on loans and mortgages.\nIn the context of your previous questions, getting a loan with a cosigner can potentially help your credit rating, but it depends on how the loan is structured and reported. If the loan is paid properly, it can have a positive effect on both people's credit ratings. However, if the loan is not paid properly, it will negatively affect both people's credit. Additionally, if the borrower does not pay, the co-signer is responsible for making the payments, which can impact their credit score as well."

FICO scoring prefers to see a large number of accounts, low utilization, high average account age, low number of inquiries, no late payment.A credit card can be a long running line of credit that will help to boost your FICO score. However if you have student loans, a mortgage, or car payments those will work just as well.  FICO that stands for Fair Isaac Corporation uses information from the 3 major credit bureaus   Equifax, Transunion and Experian. It is important to note that FICO score tracks credit not checking or savings.",

It can go generally one of three ways: A) The loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner. In this scenario, both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially this will generally drop related credit scores somewhat (it's a \"\"hard pull\"\", new account with zero history, and increased debt), but over time this can have a positive effect on both people's credit rating. This is the typical scenario one might logically expect to be the norm, and it effects both parties credit just as if they were a sole signor for the loan. And as always, if the loan is not paid properly it will negatively effect both people's credit, and the owner of the loan can choose to come after either or both parties in whatever order they want. B) The loan company just runs the loan with one person, and only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the co-signor), leaving the other as just a backup. If you aren't paying close attention they may even arrange it where the initial party wanting to take the loan isn't even on most of the paperwork. This let the person trying to run the loan get something accepted that might not have been otherwise, or save some time, or was just an error. In this case it will have no effect on Person A's credit. We've had a number of question like this, and this isn't really a rare occurrence. Never assume people selling you things are necessarily accurate or honest - always verify. C) The loan company just doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, or does so incorrectly. They are under no obligation to report to credit agencies, it's strictly up to them. If you don't pay then they can report it as something \"\"in collections\"\".",

The purpose of the credit score system is two-fold.  First, the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions (FICO's customers) to assess the risk of loans that they make.  This is probably based on science, although the FICO studies and even the FICO score formula are proprietary secrets. The second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money.  And they have done a great job of that.  If you think you might need a loan in the future, perhaps a mortgage or a car loan, you need a credit score.  And the only way to get a credit score is to start borrowing money now that you don't need.   Yes, someone with a good income and a long history of paying utility bills on time would be a great credit risk for a mortgage.  However, that person will have no credit score, and therefore be declared by FICO as a bad credit risk.  On the other hand, someone with a low income, who struggles, but succeeds, to make the minimum payment on their credit card, would have a better credit score.  The advice offered to the first person is start borrowing money now, even though you don't need it. I'm not anti-credit card.  I use a credit card responsibly, paying it off in full every month.  I use it for the convenience.  I don't worry at all about my credit score, but I've been told it is great.  However, there are some people that cannot use a credit card responsibly.  The temptation is too great.  Perhaps they are like problem gamblers, I don't know.  But FICO and the financial services industry have created a system that makes a credit card a necessity in many ways.  These are the people that get hurt in the current system.",

These have a score range of 250 to 900, so the scores are not fully comparable with \"\"classic\"\" versions. As of 2015, Auto and Bankcard scores are available from myFICO as described here. Citibank provides the Equifax FICO 8 Bankcard score free each month to credit cards holders. Each credit agency (Transunion, Equifax, and Experian) uses a customized version of each FICO edition. As a result, a consumer's FICO scores from each agency may differ even when all credit information is identical among the agencies. Because there are many FICO versions, when a score is received, it's helpful to know which version it is. If a lender provides a credit score, ask for details such as which credit agency was used, which FICO edition was used, and whether the score is an Industry Option version. The lender may not always be willing or able to provide the answers, but it doesn't hurt to ask.

It can go generally one of three ways: A) The loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner. In this scenario, both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially this will generally drop related credit scores somewhat (it's a \"\"hard pull\"\", new account with zero history, and increased debt), but over time this can have a positive effect on both people's credit rating. This is the typical scenario one might logically expect to be the norm, and it effects both parties credit just as if they were a sole signor for the loan. And as always, if the loan is not paid properly it will negatively effect both people's credit, and the owner of the loan can choose to come after either or both parties in whatever order they want. B) The loan company just runs the loan with one person, and only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the co-signor), leaving the other as just a backup. If you aren't paying close attention they may even arrange it where the initial party wanting to take the loan isn't even on most of the paperwork. This let the person trying to run the loan get something accepted that might not have been otherwise, or save some time, or was just an error. In this case it will have no effect on Person A's credit. We've had a number of question like this, and this isn't really a rare occurrence. Never assume people selling you things are necessarily accurate or honest - always verify. C) The loan company just doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, or does so incorrectly. They are under no obligation to report to credit agencies, it's strictly up to them. If you don't pay then they can report it as something \"\"in collections\"\".",

                      "model_text": "|user|: In the US, does getting a loan with a cosigner, help your credit rating? \n|assistant|: In the US getting a loan with a cosigner, it can potentially help your credit rating, but it depends on how the loan is structured and reported. However a loan with a cosigner can bring a lot problems. In the first scenario, if the loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner, then both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially, this might decrease related credit scores slightly due to a hard pull, new account with zero history, and increased debt. However, over time, it can have a positive effect on both people's credit ratings if the loan is paid properly. Conversely, if the loan is not paid properly, it will negatively affect both people's credit. In the second scenario, if the loan company only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the cosigner), leaving the other as just a backup, it will have no effect on the borrower's credit. In the third scenario, if the loan company doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, there will be no direct impact on the borrower's credit. However, if the loan goes into collections and is reported as such, it would negatively affect the borrower's credit. Nevertheless a cosigner will make sure you are going to make every single payment on time because otherwise he will be responsible to pay it  .                                    \n|user|: I see, that means if the person does not ot pay his/her loand, the cosigner will be responsability to do it right and how does this work?\n|assistant|: Yes, that's right. The co-signer is responsible for the loan just as much as borrower is. In fact if the borrower does not pay, the co-signer is liable for making the payments. When you co-sign a loan, you are essentially saying \"\"I will pay this loan if the other person can't.\"\"\" The cos-signer is 100% liable if for any reason you can't or won't pay. Also this shows up on a credit report just like it's your debt. This limits the amount you can borrow for any reason.\n|user|: It is better never be a co-signer.\n|assistant|: Actually being a cosigner for a loan involves significant responsibilities. It is the same as borrowing the money in your name and giving it right over to the borrower. Before accept be a cosigner, think it, you're just as responsible for the loan payments as the original borrower, and given that you were a useful co-signer, probably much more likely to be able to come up with the money.  If you can't pay, the lender comes after both of you  if the bank is asking for a co-signer its because they are not very confident that the applicant is going to be paying back the loan.Never co-sign a loan for someone, especially family .Taking out a loan for yourself is bad enough, but co-signing a loan is just plain stupid.  Besides, co-signer can become enraged if the original borrower does not pay the loan. As I mentioned before, be careful. Make sure you are willing to take the risk because you are promising the bank that you will make any payments that the borrower would not make it.\n|user|: credit rating/credit score\n|assistant|: First of all it is very important to understand what a credit score or credit rating is. It has a huge financial impact on consumers, even though most people don\u2019t know how they are calculated or which bad habits may be driving theirs down. Your credit score is a number on a scale of 300 to 900 that can affect all of your financial decisions, from shopping for groceries to applying for a mortgage.  A credit score is your history of accruing debt and paying it back. It is supplemented by your age, time at current residence, time at previous residences, time at your job.  Additionally, your crediting rating is also way creditors let each other know whether you are in a good position and have a strong tendency to repay your debts, not whether you are an easy target for making money on interest and penalties associated with failing to repay debts in full. There is a scale that it is considered s have a huge financial impact on consumers, even though most people don\u2019t know how they are calculated or which bad habits may be driving theirs down. Your credit score is a number on a scale of 300 to 900 that can affect all of your financial decisions, from shopping for groceries to applying for a mortgage. There is also a credit scale considered as ambiguous but they are  : AAA, AA, A, BBB, BBB-, BB+, BB, B, CCC, CC, C, D.\n|user|: FICO?\n|assistant|: FICO is financial services company, whose customers are financial services companies. The purpose of the credit score system is two-fold. First, the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions (FICO's customers) to assess the risk of loans that they make.  The second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money. FICO scoring prefers to see a large number of accounts, low utilization, high average account age, low number of inquiries, no late payment.A credit card can be a long running line of credit that will help to boost your FICO score. However if you have student loans, a mortgage, or car payments those will work just as well.  FICO that stands for Fair Isaac Corporation uses information from the 3 major credit bureaus   Equifax, Transunion and Experian. It is important to note that FICO score tracks credit not checking or savings.\n|user|: raise my credit card score"

          "text": "\nFirst, you need to be aware that the credit score reported by Mint is Equifax Credit Score. Equifax Credit Score, like FICO, Vantagescore, and others, is based on a proprietary formula that is not publicly available.  Every score is calculated with a different formula, and can vary from each other widely.  Lenders almost exclusively only use FICO scores, so the score number you have is likely different than the score lenders will use. Second, understand that the advice you see from places like Mint and Credit Karma will almost always tell you that you don't have enough credit card accounts.  The reason for this is that they make their money by referring customers to credit card applications.  They have a financial interest in telling you that you need more credit cards. Finally, realize that credit score is just a number, and is only useful for a limited number of things.  Higher is better to a point, and after that, you get no benefit from increasing your score.   My advice to you is this: Don't stress out about your credit score, especially a free score reported by Credit Karma or Mint.  If you really have a desire to find out your score, you can pay FICO to get your actual score, but it's not cheap.  You can also sometimes get your FICO score by applying for a loan and asking the lender.  I last saw my FICO scores (there were three, one from each credit bureau) when I applied for a mortgage a couple of years ago, and the mortgage rep gave them to me for free.  But honestly, knowing your score doesn't do much for you, as the best way to increase it is to simply make your payments on time and wait. Don't give in to bad conventional advice from places that are funded by the financial services industry.  The thing that makes your credit score go up is a long history of paying your bills on time.  Despite what you commonly read about credit scores, I'm not convinced that you can radically boost your scores by having lots of open credit card accounts.  At the time I applied for my last mortgage, I only had 2 open credit cards (still true), and the oldest open account was about 1.5 years old.  The average of my 3 scores was just over 800.  But I've been paying my bills on time for at least 20 years now.  Only get credit cards that you actually want, and close the ones you don't want.",

          "text": "\nGood credit is calculated (by many lenders) by taking your FICO score which is calculated based upon what is in your credit report. Building credit generally means building up your FICO score. Your FICO score is impacted my many factors, one small one of which is your utilization ratio of your installment loans like student loans. This is the ratio of the current balance to your original balance. To improve your score (slightly) you would want a lower ratio. I would recommend paying your student loan down to 75% ratio as fast as you can and then you can go back to $50/month. A much better way to improve your FICO score is to have revolving credit. Your student loans are not revolving, they are installment loans. Therefore, you should open at least one credit card (assuming you currently have none) right away. The longer you have had a credit card open, the better your FICO score gets. Your revolving credit utilization ratio is way more important than your installment loan ratio. Therefore, to maximize your FICO, try to never have more than 10% utilization on your revolving credit report to the credit bureaus each month. Only the current month's ratio affects your score at any given moment. You can ensure you don't go above 10% by paying your balance before the statement cuts each month to get it below 10% way before any payment would be due. (You should always pay your remaining credit card statement balance in full each month by the due date after the statement cuts to avoid any interest charges.) Note that there is a slight FICO advantage to having at least one major bank credit card instead of just only credit union credit cards. Also, never let all your revolving credit report a zero balance in a month, you must always have at least $1 reporting to the credit bureaus on at least one of your open credit cards or your FICO score will take a big negative hit. If you cannot get a normal credit card, go to a credit union and find one that offers secured credit cards, or a bank that does. A secured credit card is where you place a deposit with the bank that they hold and give you a credit limit to match your security. Ideally it would be a card that graduates to unsecured after your demonstrate good history with them.",

However a loan with a cosigner can bring a lot problems. In the first scenario, if the loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner, then both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially, this might decrease related credit scores slightly due to a hard pull, new account with zero history, and increased debt. However, over time, it can have a positive effect on both people's credit ratings if the loan is paid properly. Conversely, if the loan is not paid properly, it will negatively affect both people's credit. In the second scenario, if the loan company only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the cosigner), leaving the other as just a backup, it will have no effect on the borrower's credit. In the third scenario, if the loan company doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, there will be no direct impact on the borrower's credit. However, if the loan goes into collections and is reported as such, it would negatively affect the borrower's credit. Nevertheless a cosigner will make sure you are going to make every single payment on time because otherwise he will be responsible to pay it  .                                    \n|user|: I see, that means if the person does not ot pay his/her loand, the cosigner will be responsability to do it right and how does this work?\n|assistant|: Yes, that's right. The co-signer is responsible for the loan just as much as borrower is. In fact if the borrower does not pay, the co-signer is liable for making the payments. When you co-sign a loan, you are essentially saying \"\"I will pay this loan if the other person can't.\"\"\" The cos-signer is 100% liable if for any reason you can't or won't pay. Also this shows up on a credit report just like it's your debt. This limits the amount you can borrow for any reason.\n|user|: It is better never be a co-signer.\n|assistant|: Actually being a cosigner for a loan involves significant responsibilities. It is the same as borrowing the money in your name and giving it right over to the borrower. Before accept be a cosigner, think it, you're just as responsible for the loan payments as the original borrower, and given that you were a useful co-signer, probably much more likely to be able to come up with the money.

The purpose of the credit score system is two-fold. First, the credit score is intended to make it easy for lending institutions (FICO's customers) to assess the risk of loans that they make.  The second purpose of the credit score is to incentivize consumers into borrowing money. FICO scoring prefers to see a large number of accounts, low utilization, high average account age, low number of inquiries, no late payment.A credit card can be a long running line of credit that will help to boost your FICO score. However if you have student loans, a mortgage, or car payments those will work just as well.  FICO that stands for Fair Isaac Corporation uses information from the 3 major credit bureaus   Equifax, Transunion and Experian. It is important to note that FICO score tracks credit not checking or savings.\n|user|: raise my credit card score\n|assistant|: Good credit is calculated (by many lenders) by taking your FICO score which is calculated based upon what is in your credit report. Building credit generally means building up your FICO score. Your FICO score is impacted my many factors, one small one of which is your utilization ratio of your installment loans like student loans. This is the ratio of the current balance to your original balance. To improve your score (slightly) you would want a lower ratio.You can use some services  that specifically help you boost your credit card score as , boostcredit101.com .They add you as an authorized user to a credit card with a high limit, low balance, and perfect payment history. This \"\"boosts\"\" for about 30 days while you remain listed as a user on that account, which allows you to qualify for your own card or other kind of loan in that time and helps you start rebuilding your credit. You also can build a better credit by aving more credit available. So by increasing your credit limit, its lowering your credit utilization rate (one of the factors that go into your credit score) - which is a good thing. So your bank trusts you with more credit, which again is a good thing. You can also request a line of credit increase yourself without waiting for the bank to do so - but there's a 6 month wait between each increase, assuming you get one. In fact to boost your score,  use your credit card regularly and also repay  your bills on time. This will help increase your credit score. \n|user|: Why is it so important to have a good credit scores. that is so stressful ."

However a loan with a cosigner can bring a lot problems. In the first scenario, if the loan company reports the status to a credit reporting agency on behalf of both the initiating borrower and the cosigner, then both individuals get a new account on their credit report. Initially, this might decrease related credit scores slightly due to a hard pull, new account with zero history, and increased debt. However, over time, it can have a positive effect on both people's credit ratings if the loan is paid properly. Conversely, if the loan is not paid properly, it will negatively affect both people's credit. In the second scenario, if the loan company only reports to a credit agency on one of you (probably the cosigner), leaving the other as just a backup, it will have no effect on the borrower's credit. In the third scenario, if the loan company doesn't report the loan at all to a credit agency, there will be no direct impact on the borrower's credit. However, if the loan goes into collections and is reported as such, it would negatively affect the borrower's credit.

It is supplemented by your age, time at current residence, time at previous residences, time at your job, etc. A person with zero debt history can still have a decent score - provided they are well established, a little older and have a good job.  The top scores are reserved for those that manage what creditors consider an \"\"appropriate\"\" amount of debt and are well established.  In other words, you're good with money and likely have long term roots in the community.  After all, creditors don't normally like being the first one you try out... Being young and having recently moved you are basically a \"\"flight risk\"\".  Meaning someone who is more likely to just pick up and move when the debt becomes too much. So, you have a couple options.  The first is to simply wait.  Keep going to work, keep living where you are, etc.  As you establish yourself you become less of a risk.   The second is to start incurring debt.  Personally, I am not a fan of this one.  Some people do well by getting a small credit card, using some portion of it each month and paying it off immediately.  Others don't know how to control that very well and end up having a few months where they roll balances over etc which becomes a trap that costs them far more than before. If I were in your position, I'd likely do one of two things.  Either buy the phone outright and sign up for a regular mobile plan OR take the cheaper phone for a couple years.\"",

          "text": "\nThe whole point of a credit report and, by extension, a credit score, is to demonstrate (and judge) your ability to repay borrowed funds.  Everything stems from that goal; available credit, payment history, collections, etc all serve to demonstrate whether or not you personally are a good investment for lenders to pursue. Revolving credit balances are tricky because they are more complicated than fixed loans (for the rest of this answer, I'll just talk about credit cards, though it also applies to lines of credit such as overdraft protection for checking accounts, HELOCs, and other such products). Having a large available balance relative to your income means that at any time you could suddenly drown yourself in debt.  Having no credit cards means you don't have experience managing them (and personal finances are governed largely by behavior, meaning experience is invaluable).  Having credit cards but carrying a high balance means you know how to borrow money, but not pay it back.  Having credit cards but carrying no balance means you don't know how to borrow money (or you don't trust yourself to pay it back). Ideally, lenders will see a pattern of you borrowing a portion of the available credit, and then paying it down.  Generally that means utilizing up to 30% of your available credit.  Even if you maintain the balance in that range without paying it off completely, it at least shows that you have restraint, and are able to stop spending at a limit you personally set, rather than the limit the bank sets for you. So, to answer your question, 0% balance on your credit cards is bad because you might as well not have them.  Use it, pay it off, rinse and repeat, and it will demonstrate your ability to exercise self control as well as your ability to repay your debts.",

      "original_text": "Having a good credit score is important because it can significantly impact various financial aspects of your life. Lenders often use credit scores to determine the risk associated with lending money, which can affect the interest rates and terms of loans. A higher credit score can lead to better loan offers, including lower interest rates and more favorable terms. On the other hand, a lower credit score may result in higher interest rates, less favorable terms, or even denial of credit.\nAdditionally, credit scores can influence other financial decisions, such as renting an apartment or obtaining insurance. Landlords and insurance companies may use credit scores to assess the reliability and financial responsibility of applicants. A good credit score can increase the likelihood of approval and access to better rates and terms.\nWhile maintaining a good credit score can be stressful, understanding the factors that contribute to your credit score and practicing good financial habits can help alleviate some of this stress. Paying bills on time, maintaining low balances on credit cards, and limiting new credit inquiries are some ways to maintain and improve your credit score."
