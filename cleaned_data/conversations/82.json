At best, spam is annoying. At worst, it\u2019s pushing scams or trying to install malware on your device. If you\u2019re tired of getting spam, there are some ways to help.When scammers send\u00a0spammy messages that seem legit (but aren\u2019t), they\u2019re often trying to trick you into clicking links and giving them\u00a0personal or financial information. Things like your passwords or bank account and Social Security numbers are valuable to scammers. With that access to your accounts, scammers could try to steal your money or\u00a0your identity. Or both.To help you cut down on spam and avoid scams:Use filters. Your mobile phone probably has options to\u00a0filter and block texts from unknown senders. Some wireless providers and call blocking apps can also help block unwanted messages. Many popular email providers (like Gmail) have strong\u00a0spam filters turned on by default. But if any spam gets into your inbox, mark it as\u00a0spam or junk.Protect your personal information. Before you enter personal information on a website, email, or text chain, stop. Ask yourself: Why do they need this information? And what\u2019s going to happen to it? Remember, too: never share your Social Security number with someone who reaches out to you.\u00a0 \u00a0Unsubscribe from unwanted emails. Getting fewer unwanted emails helps you avoid clicking on links that can lead to a\u00a0phishing attack.Report unwanted messages. Unwanted messages often lead to scams. Report them.",

Then  they tell you there is a fee, some taxes, or customs duties to pay. They ask for your bank account information, or ask you to send money via a wire transfer or to purchase gift cards and provide the card numbers. Government Impostor scams  are also very common : You get a text, call, or email from someone who says they are with the government. They may claim to be a U.S. Marshal, saying you must pay a fine for missing jury duty. Or the IRS, saying that you owe thousands in back taxes. Another scam that you must be alert occurs  when someone gets an email or most often a phone call and the caller begins speaking very quickly about common computer issues that slow performance or even potential hacks to your system. There are imposter scammers  that try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization. Today, phishing  is very common . the scammer  impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you.",

The Federal Trade Commission offers information about preventing and responding to identify theft.\n\n Imposter scams\n \n\nImposter scammers try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization. Remember, caller ID can be faked. You can always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them before giving any money.\n\n Mail fraud\n \n\nMail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake. A common warning sign is a letter asking you to send money or personal information now to get something valuable after you send the money or information.\n\n Phishing\n \n\nIn phishing, a scammer impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you. These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn\u2019t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts. Read more.\n\n Spoofing\n \n\nSpoofing occurs when a caller disguises the information shown on your caller ID. This gives the caller the ability to disguise or \"spoof\" the name and/or number to appear as though they are calling as a certain person from a specific location.\n\n Wire or money transfer fraud\n \n\nSome scammers trick you into wiring or transferring money to steal from you.

In the context of food assistance programs, scammers may send unsolicited text messages offering work-at-home opportunities or referencing \"food stamps\" to steal personal information. It is essential to remain vigilant and not share confidential information, like Social Security numbers or EBT card details, with unknown individuals or organizations.

The caller will indicate that the \"relative\" has been involved in some type of law enforcement interaction such as a car crash or an arrest. The caller requests funds for bail, an attorney or perhaps insurance deductible fees.Please verify the relationship with actual family members! Do not be pressured into wiring money without verification. Wired transactions that are not halted within the first 15-30 minutes are usually non-reversible causing the victim to be out of pocket of any funds wired. The callers can be very convincing and often target older adults and senior citizens.Computer Repair / Microsoft Scam:\u00a0Computer repair scams are on the rise, and unsuspecting citizens can fall prey to these smooth talking sales pitches if they are uninformed. This scam occurs when someone gets an email or most often a phone call and the caller begins speaking very quickly about common computer issues that slow performance or even potential hacks to your system. The high pressure tactics are designed to convince you that they need immediate access to your PC to make urgent repairs to your operating system or to stop a hack already in progress.Some of these callers even claim to be from or affiliated with Microsoft in an effort to legitimize their scam.",

The Federal Trade Commission offers information about preventing and responding to identify theft.\n\n Imposter scams\n \n\nImposter scammers try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization. Remember, caller ID can be faked. You can always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them before giving any money.\n\n Mail fraud\n \n\nMail fraud letters look real but the promises are fake. A common warning sign is a letter asking you to send money or personal information now to get something valuable after you send the money or information.\n\n Phishing\n \n\nIn phishing, a scammer impersonates a business or a person to trick you into giving out your personal information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or bank account information. A scammer may use fraudulent emails, texts, or websites to steal this information from you. These emails can look authentic.\n\n Security freeze for prevention\n \n\nA security freeze prevents new creditors from accessing your credit file and others from opening accounts requiring a credit check in your name, until you lift the freeze.Because most businesses will not open credit accounts without checking your credit report, a freeze can stop identity thieves from opening new accounts in your name. Be mindful that a freeze doesn\u2019t prevent identity thieves from taking over existing accounts. Read more.\n\n Spoofing\n \n\nSpoofing occurs when a caller disguises the information shown on your caller ID. This gives the caller the ability to disguise or \"spoof\" the name and/or number to appear as though they are calling as a certain person from a specific location.\n\n Wire or money transfer fraud\n \n\nSome scammers trick you into wiring or transferring money to steal from you. One common example of a wire transfer fraud is the \u201cgrandparent scam.\u201d",

      "original_text": "Yes, there are certain times of the year when scams are more prevalent. During tax season, scammers often target individuals with fraudulent activities related to taxes. They may pose as tax officials or preparers and attempt to steal personal information or encourage the filing of false returns. Additionally, natural disasters or crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, can lead to an increase in scams as criminals exploit the situation to deceive people. It's essential to remain vigilant and follow precautions against scams throughout the year, but particularly during these high-risk periods."
