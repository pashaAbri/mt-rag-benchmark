These are the instances when the Moon 's apparent geocentric celestial longitude minus the Sun 's apparent geocentric celestial longitude is 0 \u00b0 , 90 \u00b0 , 180 \u00b0 and 270 \u00b0 , respectively . Each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on the Earth . During the intervals between principal phases , the Moon appears either crescent - shaped or gibbous . These shapes , and the periods of time when the Moon shows them , are called the intermediate phases . They last , on average , one - quarter of a synodic month , roughly 7.38 days , but their durations vary slightly because the Moon 's orbit is slightly elliptical , and thus its speed in orbit is not constant . The descriptor waxing is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon 's apparent size is increasing , from new moon toward full moon , and waning when the size is decreasing .",

The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth , according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth . The Moon 's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth 's gravity , therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth . This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit . Therefore , the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100 % ( full moon ) to 0 % ( new moon ) . The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres . Each of the four `` intermediate '' lunar phases ( see below ) is roughly seven days ( ~ 7.4 days ) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon 's orbit . Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker , all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight , followed by 14.77 days of `` night '' .

The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth , according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth . The Moon 's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth 's gravity , therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth . This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit . Therefore , the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100 % ( full moon ) to 0 % ( new moon ) . The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres . Each of the four `` intermediate '' lunar phases ( see below ) is roughly seven days ( ~ 7.4 days ) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon 's orbit . Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker , all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight , followed by 14.77 days of `` night '' .

When a sphere is illuminated on one hemisphere and viewed from a different angle , the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two - dimensional shape defined by the intersection of an ellipse and circle ( where the major axis of the ellipse coincides with a diameter of the circle ) . If the half - ellipse is convex with respect to the half - circle , then the shape will be gibbous ( bulging outwards ) whereas if the half - ellipse is concave with respect to the half - circle , then the shape will be a crescent .\n|user|: What is the distance between the moon and earth?\n|assistant|: I do not have specific information on the current distance between the Moon and Earth. However, it's worth noting that the average distance from the Moon to the Earth is about 238,855 miles or 384,400 kilometers. But this distance varies throughout the Moon's orbit, ranging from about 225,623 miles or 363,104 kilometers at its closest, to about 252,088 miles or 405,696 kilometers at its farthest. Lunar distance (astronomy) Astronomers O'Keefe and Anderson calculated the lunar distance by observing 4 occultations from 9 locations in 1952 . They calculated a mean distance of 7008384407600000000 \u2660 384 407. 6 \u00b1 4.7 km , however the value was refined by in 1962 by Irene Fischer , who incorporated updated geodetic data to produce a value of 7008384403700000000 \u2660 384 403. 7 \u00b1 2 km .\n|user|: How old is the moon?\n|assistant|: The age of the Moon is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, it's worth noting that scientific estimates suggest the Moon is approximately 4.6 billion years old, which is thought to be close to the age of the Earth.\n|user|: What was the longest mission to the moon?\n|assistant|: The provided documents do not contain specific information about the longest mission to the Moon. However, Apollo 17, which lasted for 12 days, 13 hours, and 51 minutes, is often cited as the longest crewed mission to the Moon.\n|user|: what makes monkeys suitable for space travel?\n|assistant|: The documents provided do not include specific information about what makes monkeys suitable for space travel. Generally, animals are selected for space missions based on their physical resilience, size, and ability to perform certain tasks. Monkeys have been used in space experiments due to their similarities to humans in terms of physiology and genetics. However, the specific reasons why monkeys were chosen for space travel would depend on the goals and constraints of each individual mission.  Primates have been used in space missions .\n|user|: What was collected from the surface of the moon?"
