On credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer, who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee.  In the case of a large purchase item like a car, the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest, something they are willing to do to make the sale.  They will typically be less prone to deal as low a price in negotiation if you were not making that deal, or at times they may offer either a rebate or special low to zero finance rates, but you don't get both.",

They loan you the money. You make payments over months or years, if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, plus their finance expenses they make money. Of course the money takes years to come in, or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount. You trade in a car and they sell it at a profit. Of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car... They or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance, or you buy lots of expensive dealer options. Some dealers wave two deals in front of you: get a 0% interest loan. These tend to be shorter 12 months vs 36,48,60 or even 72 months. The shorter length makes it harder for many to afford. If you can't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget. pay cash and get a rebate. If you take the rebate you can't get the 0% loan. If you take the 0% loan you can't get the rebate. The price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit. The key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in. Don't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized. Otherwise they will adjust the price, rebate, interest rate, length of loan,  and trade-in value to maximize their profit. The suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one. If you get a loan for 2% from your bank/credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer, it will cost less in total than the 0% loan from the dealer. The key is to get the loan approved by the bank/credit union before meeting with the dealer. The money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer.",

      "original_text": "A 0% interest rate offer can provide some benefits of both paying in cash and financing. With a 0% interest rate, you can effectively borrow money from the dealership without paying any interest, which can make your payments lower and more manageable. This can be similar to financing with a low interest rate. At the same time, because you are not paying any interest, you will end up paying the same total price for the car as you would if you paid in cash, assuming you pay off the loan within the promotional period. This can be beneficial if you want to preserve your savings by not paying the full price of the car upfront. However, it's important to note that 0% interest rate offers are often only available to customers with excellent credit, so not everyone will qualify for these deals. Additionally, if you are unable to pay off the loan within the promotional period, you may be charged a higher interest rate or other penalties, so it's important to read the terms and conditions carefully before agreeing to a 0% interest rate offer."

You can purchase a used car warranty, but they are expensive, and often come with (different) problems. Finance Terms - A buyer can purchase a new vehicle with lower financing rate than a used vehicle. And you get nothing of value from the additional finance charges, so the difference between a new and used car also includes higher finance costs. Own versus Rent - You are assuming that people actually want to 'own' their cars. And I would suggest that people want to 'own' their car until it begins to present problems (repair and maintenance issues), and then they want a new vehicle to replace it. But renting or leasing a vehicle is an even more expensive, and less flexible means to obtain transportation. Expense Allocation - A vehicle is an expense. As the owner of a vehicle, you are willing to pay for that expense, to fill your need for transportation. Paying for the product as you use the product makes sense, and financing is one way to align the payment with the consumption of the product, and to pay for the expense of the vehicle as you enjoy the benefit of the vehicle. Capital Allocation - A buyer may need a vehicle (either to commute to work, school, doctor, or for work or business), but either lack the capital or be unwilling to commit the capital to the vehicle purchase. Vehicle financing is one area banks have been willing to lend, so buying a new vehicle may free capital to use to pay down other debts (credit cards, loans). The buyer may not have savings, but be able to obtain financing to solve that need. Remember, people need transportation. And they are willing to pay to fill their need. But they also have varying needs for all of the above factors, and each of those factors may offer value to different individuals.",

You really want to understand a little of the statistics before you can make a generic call, but my rule of thumb is that insurance via \"\"extended warranty\"\" is rarely a good deal. Here is a simple expected value math formula you can apply (when the > is true, then you should buy it): replacement cost x likelihood of using warranty % > cost of insurance You can then back-compute, what is the likelihood that I'd need to lose this item to break even? Given your numbers: $2000 x Y > $350 or Y > (350/2000) or Y > 17.5% So if you think there is a 17.5% or greater chance that you'll need to have you system replaced (i.e. not just a simple fix) AND (as Scott pointed out) you'll be able to actually use the replacement warranty then the applecare is a good purchase. Note, this only applies to items you can replace out-of-pocket without significant burden, because if you didn't have the $10k to replace your car, it wouldn't matter if the insurance wasn't such a good deal (especially if you need the car to get to work, etc.) So the obvious question is: \"\"Why would a for-profit company ever offer insurance on something they are statistically likely to lose money on?\"\" The obvious answer is \"\"they wouldn't,\"\" but that doesn't mean you should never buy this type of insurance, because you may have statistically significant circumstances. For instance, I purchased a $40 remote helicopter as a gift for my children. I also paid the $5 for a \"\"no questions asked\"\" warranty on it because, knowing my kids, I knew there was a nearly 100% chance they would break it at least once. In this case, this warranty was well worth the $5, because they did break it! Presumably they make money on these warranties because most of the purchasers of the plan are more attentive (or too lazy to make the claim) than in this case.",

      "original_text": "Whether you need an extra warranty on your new car depends on various factors, such as the manufacturer's warranty coverage, your driving habits, and your risk tolerance. New cars usually come with a factory warranty covering defects and repairs for a certain period. If you drive less, have a good track record with cars, and are comfortable with the manufacturer's warranty, you might not need an additional warranty. However, if you drive more, have had issues with cars in the past, or want additional peace of mind, purchasing an extended warranty could be beneficial. It's essential to read the terms and conditions of the warranty and consider your personal needs before making a decision."

If progress continues at the pace it has up to now, then by 2025 we might see the 3rd gen EVs appearing and I expect they'll have 300+ range starting around $25K.

Also the market will grow to say 25M but instead of adding 5M capacity, we would really have to add 25M capacity b.c EV is currently 0.

It's also good for the environment (the electricity used is much cleaner than gasoline/diesel) and electrical grid (increased demand that's potentially responsive to system load helps finance smart grid improvements).",

If an EV's battery is not expected to last long, it may negatively impact its resale value. However, major car manufacturers like Toyota, GM, and Nissan have conducted extensive research and testing to ensure the durability of their battery packs. While some companies have had success, others like Nissan have faced heat-related issues due to the lack of a liquid cooling system. Overall, enhanced battery technology is needed to improve the lifespan of EV batteries and their impact on the used car market."
