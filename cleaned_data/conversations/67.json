Each method of an SDK SHOULD correspond to exactly one operation of the underlying API, and this relationship should be clear from design of the API.\n\nOperations whose functionality is fully supported by a related operation SHOULD be omitted. This can occur, for example, when an operation is exposed with both a GET and an POST method, where the GET offers a subset of the features of the POST but with a simpler interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n Methods \n\nMethods MUST employ a flexible parameter-passing design that allows optional parameters to be added to a method without causing incompatibility with applications using the prior version of the method.\n\nIn some languages this can be accomplished using standard language features like default parameter values, but in other languages (e.g. Java) the method parameters must be encapsulated into an \"options\" object.\n\n\n\n\n\n Streaming \n\nFor a language/runtime that supports stream value types:\n\n\n\n* The SDK SHOULD allow any potentially large input value to a method to be supplied as a stream.\n* The SDK SHOULD allow the result of a method to be returned as a stream if that value may be large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Asynchronous method calls \n\nThe SDK MUST support asynchronous invocation of any method that performs a network operation. The SDK SHOULD support synchronous or pseudo-synchronous (e.g. async/await) invocation of methods that perform network operation in languages where this method style is idiomatic.\n\n\n\n\n\n Instrumentation \n\nThe SDK SHOULD be instrumented so that relevant usage data can be collected by the service.",

However, there are no mentioned limitations of the CocoaPods method that would require switching to a different method. \n|user|: carthage?\n|assistant|: Yes, you can also use Carthage as an alternative to CocoaPods for installing the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile.  Note that this method requires manual addition of the framework to the Xcode project, unlike CocoaPods which automatically generates a workspace file for you to open the project in Xcode.\n|user|: any example of code for cart ahh sauce rather?\n|assistant|: Sure, here's an example of how to install the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile using Carthage: 1. Create a file named `Cartfile` in the project directory for your app and add the following line: `github \"openwhisk/openwhisk-client-swift.git\" > 0.3.0 Or latest version` 2. From the command line, navigate to the project directory and type `carthage update --platform ios`. Carthage will download and build the SDK, creating a directory called `Carthage` in the project directory for your app, and putting an `OpenWhisk.framework` file inside `Carthage/build/iOS`. 3. Add the `OpenWhisk.framework` file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project. \n|user|: Excuse me, I meant source code example, rather.\n|assistant|: I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here's an example of how to install the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile using Carthage from the source code:\n1. Clone the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-client-swift.git`\n2. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd openwhisk-client-swift`\n3. Install Carthage: `brew install carthage`\n4. Run `carthage bootstrap` to build the framework.\n5.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces.

Note that this method requires manual addition of the framework to the Xcode project, unlike CocoaPods which automatically generates a workspace file for you to open the project in Xcode.\n|user|: any example of code for cart ahh sauce rather?\n|assistant|: Sure, here's an example of how to install the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile using Carthage: 1. Create a file named `Cartfile` in the project directory for your app and add the following line: `github \"openwhisk/openwhisk-client-swift.git\" > 0.3.0 Or latest version` 2. From the command line, navigate to the project directory and type `carthage update --platform ios`. Carthage will download and build the SDK, creating a directory called `Carthage` in the project directory for your app, and putting an `OpenWhisk.framework` file inside `Carthage/build/iOS`. 3. Add the `OpenWhisk.framework` file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project. \n|user|: Excuse me, I meant source code example, rather.\n|assistant|: I apologize for the misunderstanding.

Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd openwhisk-client-swift`\n3. Install Carthage: `brew install carthage`\n4. Run `carthage bootstrap` to build the framework.\n5. Add the `OpenWhisk.framework` file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project.\n|user|: ok, you don't get it. this a part of clpud service? any additional charge?\n|assistant|: The IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution and is free to use as part of the IBM Cloud Functions service.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.",
