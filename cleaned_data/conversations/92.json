Who do I call about missed collection of garbage/recycling/organics service?\n\nA. Call Republic Services at their toll- free number, (800) 320-8077 before 12 noon for a return trip on the same day.\n\nQ. I need a replacement cart because mine is damaged or missing. Who do I call?\n\nA. Call Republic Services at their toll-free number, (800) 320-8077. Republic Services will also provide additional recyclables and organics carts at no extra cost.\n\nQ. Where should I place my carts for collection?\n\nA. Customers with on-premises (backyard) collection service should keep all their carts in an accessible location out of view from the street in the side or rear yard. The blue recycling cart should be kept next to the black and green carts and does not need to be taken to the curb.\n\nCustomers who have opted to have Curbside collection service should place all their carts within three feet of the curb for collection no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the day prior to the scheduled collection day and must remove all carts from the curb no later than 12:00 midnight on the scheduled collection day. Customers may not place carts in a public street, or public sidewalk, but may place carts in the right-of-way parking strip. To help reduce scavenging, please place the carts out before 7:00 a.m.\n\nShould you need a trash enclosure to screen your bins please see the Trash Enclosure Information Brochure.\n\nQ. What should I do if I see someone other than the recycling company taking recyclables from my Blue Recycling Cart?\n\nA. Get a description of the person and/or the make and model of the vehicle and call the police non-emergency number, (510) 420-3000.\n\nGet Detailed Information on These Services:\nOrganics | Recycling | Garbage | Hazardous Waste | Bulky Items | E Waste \n| \nFAQ | Climate Action | Ordinances and Regulations \n| \nConstruction & Demolition Debris Recycling | Resources \n\nPiedmont Evergreen",

Collection service for recyclables and organics is unlimited in volume and provided at no additional cost. By recycling more and generating less garbage, you may be able to switch to a smaller garbage cart to save money. But be sure to choose the right container for your garbage needs. Charges will be assessed for overflowing garbage, garbage set out beyond your service level, or allowing garbage to accumulate on your property. Recycling carts and organics carts contaminated with garbage will not be serviced. Call Republic Services at (800) 320-8077 to order additional or larger carts for recyclables and organics.\nOn-premises (backyard) collection service costs more than curbside service. Switching to curbside service saves approximately $50 per month. With curbside collection, the customer is responsible for placing the wheeled carts at the curb on their regular collection service day and returning the carts to their storage location promptly after collection. With curbside collection, carts are not limited in size as they are with on-premises collection.\nAn Annual Pre-Payment Discount allows single family customers to voluntarily pay for one (1) year of service with the twelfth (12th) month of service provided at no charge. That is 12 months of service for the cost of 11 months of service.\n\n Physically disabled residential customers with no able-bodied household members are eligible to receive on-premises (backyard) collection at curbside rates. The maximum cart size available to on-premises collection is 35 gallons. To receive the discount, the account holder must fill out the application for exemption to curbside placement of carts, provide a doctor's certification that the customer is unable to move the carts to the curb or provide a copy of a valid California Disability Placard, and verify that there are no able-bodied household members that can move the carts to the curb.\n\nService Rates for Single Family Residences\n\nQ. What are the Service Rates for Single Family Residences?\n\nA. Single family residential prices are based on the size of the garbage cart.

According to the Piedmont Municipal Code, every owner of any premises is required to ensure that arrangements are made to properly dispose of solid waste, recyclable material, and organic waste created, produced, or accumulated on the premises.

The result is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier environment. To learn more, visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website.\n\nQ. How do I recycle food scraps?\n\nA. Collect food scraps and food-soiled paper in the green kitchen pail. Empty the pail contents into the large green Organics cart for collection. DO NOT place the kitchen pail outside for collection. Refer to the service guide at the top of this page for additional information and hints on Food Scrap Recycling. You can also visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website to learn more.\n\nQ. If I put my food scraps down the garbage disposal, do they get composted?\n\nA. No. These food scraps from household garbage disposals end up in the wastewater system and do not get composted. However, the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) wastewater treatment plant at the base of the Bay Bridge in Oakland not only treats sewage but takes food scraps from restaurants and supermarkets that usually go to the landfill and converts them into renewable energy. The process is a natural microbial activity called anaerobic digestion which converts these food scraps into biogas, which is used to power EBMUD's wastewater plant. The excess energy is sold back to the grid or used as carbon credits. The project supports local and regional efforts towards green- house gas reduction (climate change), oil independence, zero waste and landfill reduction.\n\nQ. I'm interested in home composting. Where can I get more information?\n\nA. Home composting information can be found on the StopWaste.org website.\n\nI am interested in Recycling the Right Way\n\nQ. Is recycling free?\n\nA. Recycling is a weekly, unlimited service and included at no extra cost.\n\nQ. What goes in the Blue Recycling Cart?",

On those periodic occasions when a single-family customer has additional green waste more than what can be placed in the Green Organics Cart, they may call Republic Services at (800) 320-8077 to request overage bags in which to place the additional plant debris. Organics collection is unlimited in volume and is provided at no additional cost. If a customer regularly finds that they have more yard debris than will fit in the green Organics cart, they can call Republic Services to request an additional green cart.\n\nQ. Why should I recycle food scraps?\n\nA. Properly sorting your food scraps and food soiled paper not only helps fight climate change, it's now the law. Effective January 2022, State law (SB 1383) requires all residents and businesses to keep compostable and recyclable materials of of California's landfills and subscribe to organics collective services. Food scraps and food soiled paper are the largest single item in our waste stream - making up approximately 35% of what we throw away in Alameda County. Food scraps are a resource, not a waste. By participating in the food scrap recycling program, food scraps and food soiled paper are sent to a composting facility. Instead of taking up space in the landfill, your food scraps become compost - a valuable resource used by landscapers and farmers. The result is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier environment. To learn more, visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website.\n\nQ. How do I recycle food scraps?\n\nA.

          "text": "Latex Allergy Information\nThis sap is used in manufacturing latex products. If someone who is sensitive to this protein comes in contact with it by touching or breathing it, an allergic reaction can occur. This allergic reaction can range from a simple skin rash to shock (which is rare). The amount of latex exposure needed to produce sensitization or an allergic reaction is unknown, but frequent exposure to latex proteins increases the risk.\nPeople who experience allergic symptoms should avoid contact until medically evaluated. Some other chemicals used in the manufacture of gloves may also cause sensitization and serious reactions, particularly skin reactions.\nWhat items contain natural rubber latex?\nLatex is used in a variety of products. Many everyday items contain latex but not all brands of all these items always contain latex. Check labels or contact the manufacturer. Following are examples of some products that may contain latex:\n\nmedical devices, such as gloves, syringes, blood pressure cuffs, bandages, IV tubes and catheters;\ndental items, such as toothbrushes with rubber grips, irrigation tips, dams, orthodontic rubber bands and elastic;\nclothing items, such as the elastic waistband in pants, underwear, sneakers, socks and pantyhose, swimsuits;\nchildren's items such as bottle nipples, diapers, rubber pants, pacifiers, teething toys, infant gum massagers and toys;\nhousehold items such as flooring, rug mats, bathmats, rubber gloves, tires and mats;\npersonal care items such as diaphragms, condoms and adult diapers;\noffice supplies such as rubber bands and erasers;\nschool supplies such as erasers, rubber cement and paint.\n\nHow common is an allergy to natural rubber latex?\nIt is difficult to determine just how widespread a problem latex allergy may be. Less than 1 percent of the general population is reported to have a reaction to latex. Despite this, more than 1,700 cases of latex allergy have been reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1988. Many more cases probably go unreported. Latex allergy reactions occur more frequently in high-risk professions due to increased exposure to latex products.",

Businesses, nonprofits, institutions, schools, and multi-family properties must: subscribe to compost (organics) and recycling collection service (or have an approved waiver on file); place color-coded labeled recycling and compost bins next to all garbage bins (not required in restrooms); and sort materials into the proper bins and inform employees, tenants, and contractors of the rules (at least annually and during move in and move out). In addition, some businesses that generate surplus edible food must recover and donate their surplus edible food and feed people.

Please refer to the Builders\u2019 Guide to Reuse & Recycling for information on salvage and reuse service providers.\n Q: How do I estimate the weight of materials reused or salvaged? \n A: You should use the attached City approved Conversion Table for Salvage and Reuse to estimate the weight of these materials.\n Q: How do I comply with the Diversion Goal if more than 65% of the debris generated is not recyclable? \n A: If unique circumstances make it infeasible for you to comply with the Diversion Goal, you may apply, in writing, to the Building Official for an exemption.\n Q: What is the penalty for not complying with the Ordinance? \n A: Violation of a City ordinance, such as the Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling Ordinance, is considered an infraction that may result in a fine. \n Q: Are these requirements necessary? \n A: Yes. C&D debris represents a significant portion of the City\u2019s overall waste stream.

      "original_text": "Alameda County has indeed implemented three mandatory recycling ordinances. These ordinances aim to reduce the amount of recyclable and compostable materials deposited in landfills from various sources, including businesses, institutions, single-family and multi-family properties, and self-haulers. The primary objective is to help the state reach its long-term goal of reducing waste by ensuring that 75% of recyclables and compostables are diverted from the landfill by 2025.\nThe Organics Reduction and Recycling Ordinance, which went into effect on January 1, 2022, focuses on keeping food and other compostable materials (\"organics\") out of landfills to reduce emissions contributing to climate change. This law affects all generators of compostable and recyclable materials, with varying requirements for different generators. Non-compliance with these ordinances may result in penalties, typically in the form of fines for violating a City ordinance.\nFor instance, the Construction and Demolition Debris Recycling Ordinance requires that projects with a building permit valuation greater than or equal to $50,000 divert at least 65% of the debris generated from going to a landfill. Violation of this ordinance may lead to fines for non-compliance.\nTo learn more about the specific requirements and potential penalties for each ordinance, you can refer to the Alameda County website or consult the relevant City departments responsible for enforcing these regulations."
