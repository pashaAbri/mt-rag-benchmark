But even when you don\u2019t have much time to focus on yourself, you can take small steps to make healthy eating and physical activity part of your routine. They\u2019ll go a long way to help protect your health \u2014 and will keep you at your best for those you love.\nLearn how Joni makes time to move her way and finds creative ways to eat healthy with a baby and a young child.\n\nHow I move my way\n\nBefore I had kids, I was pretty active. I spent lots of weekends hiking or going on bike rides with friends. But 2 pregnancies in just over 4 years changed all that!\nAfter my second child was born, I was constantly tired and just didn\u2019t have any energy. I knew it was partly because I wasn\u2019t getting enough sleep at night \u2014 but I also realized that I missed getting active. I found that getting outside even for just 15 minutes and taking a quick walk gave me an energy boost, and it helped me feel more like my old self. I take the kids along in the stroller \u2014 sometimes we stop by the park, and my older child and I play ball while the baby naps.\nThat\u2019s not to say getting active is easy with a young child and a baby in the house! Taking them with me on walks is a challenge sometimes \u2014 and when I finally get some time to myself after the kids are in bed, physical activity usually isn\u2019t the first thing on my list. But I try my best to get active a few times a week, whether it\u2019s outside or with an online exercise video. I don\u2019t always get to do as much as I\u2019d like, but that\u2019s okay!",

It is vital for healthy aging and can reduce the burden of chronic diseases and prevent early death. Yet, only about 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 6 high school students fully meet the recommendations in the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.\nAccess to safe places to play and walk, such as parks, safe streets, trails, and greenways, is important for physical activity. It is also important to be able to safely and easily walk, bike, or take transit to everyday destinations such as homes, workplaces, schools, parks, health care, and food outlets.\nAdditionally, many people from racial and ethnic minority groups and from rural areas are less likely to have access to these safe spaces. Historical land use as well as housing and transportation policies can contribute to limited access. People impacted by these disparities are also less likely to meet the physical activity recommendations.\nDesigning communities to provide access to these safe spaces for everyone helps increase physical activity and can provide better places to live. It can also help improve health equity.\nConnect activity-friendly routes to everyday destinations\nTip\u200e\nImplement policies and activities to connect pedestrian, bicycle, or transit transportation networks (called activity-friendly routes) to everyday destinations.To align with the Community Preventive Services Task Force's built environment recommendation, increasing physical activity through community design needs to include at least one element from activity-friendly routes plus one element from everyday destinations. Possibilities for each are below.\nSee recommendation\n\nActivity-Friendly Routes\n\nEveryday Destinations\n\nThese may include new or improved:\r\n\nStreet pattern design and connectivity, such as convenient, connected, and accessible streets that create many route options, shorter block lengths, and shorter crossing distances.",

However, some general guidelines include ensuring children are supervised during activities, using appropriate safety gear, and engaging in age-appropriate exercises. For sports-related activities, following the rules and guidelines set by the sport's organization can help maintain safety.

Neon pink and neon orange offer the most visibility for light-bottomed pools. For lakes and dark-bottomed pools, neon green, neon orange and neon yellow are the most visible.\nConsider learning CPR. In an emergency, every second counts.\n\nBe aware of the conditions. \r\n\t\nOcean swimming is very different from pool swimming, so be prepared for powerful waves, strong surf and sudden drop-offs. \nRip currents usually form near a shallow point in the water, and can happen at any beach with breaking waves, including the Great Lakes. If you are caught in a rip current, try to remain calm and\r\n\tdon't fight it. Swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current, and float or tread water if you begin to tire. More from the National Weather Service: Break the Grip of the Rip! \nKeep away from the water's edge. Jagged, slippery rocks and murky waters can be hazardous.\n\nBe aware of the rules.\r\n\t\nSwim only in designated areas, and only when a lifeguard is on duty. Prohibited swim areas are often accompanied by dangers such as turbulent underwater currents, extreme cold, and widely varying depths. \r\n\tThese hazards can put even good swimmers at risk.\nChoose a swimming spot near a lifeguard for maximum visibility. Always follow their directions, and ensure that any children you are swimming with do the same.\nWatch for warning flags and know what they mean. Green flags usually mark designated swimming areas - be sure to swim between the green flags. Yellow flags may denote a surfing beach or an advisory. \r\n\tRed flags indicate a danger or hazard. Flag designations may vary, so be sure to understand the color coding before you dive in.\n\nBe attentive.\r\n\t\nAlways swim sober.\nIf you're swimming with children, designate a \"water watcher\" who will always keep a close eye on the kids. This person shouldn't be reading, using a phone, or doing anything but observing. \r\n\tNever let children swim unattended.",
