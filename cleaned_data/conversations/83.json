DEC regulations prohibit boats from launching or leaving sites without first draining the boat and cleaning the boat, trailer and equipment. Furthermore, many New York counties, towns, and villages also have laws in place that prohibit the transport of aquatic invasive species on boats, trailers and equipment.To avoid spreading invasive species, follow the 'Clean.Drain.Dry.' method for properly disinfecting your boat and equipment before launching. If you need help, many public boat launches have boat stewards on-site to inspect your watercraft and gear.Use our interactive map feature to locate a boat inspection station and boat steward near you.Certificate Requirements for Boating in the Adirondack Park: As of June 2022, all boaters operating any kind of motorized watercraft in the Adirondack Park and within ten miles of the Blue Line are required by law to possess certification that their vessel has undergone the proper cleaning measures to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. Boaters can get their certification from a boat steward at a DEC designated inspection station or by completing a self-issued certificate (PDF) prior to launch. Have questions about this new regulation? See our Frequently Asked Questions (PDF)Register your Boat at the DMVIf you use a motor (electric or fuel-driven), no matter how small the craft or the motor, you must register your boat with the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).You can either register your boat online or call the DMV at (518) 486-9786. (Note: In New York, watercraft without a motor do not need to be registered.)Boating Safety Courses and CertificationFor information about boating certificate requirements and boating safety courses, call the OPRHP at (518) 474-0456 or visit the OPRHP boating education page.",

However, if you lost temporary certificates, the temporary certificates cannot be replaced. If you are within 7 days of your temporary certificate\u2019s expiration date and have not yet received your card, you are advised to email [boating@parks.ny.gov](mailto:boating@parks.ny.gov). However, please note that NYS can only issue replacement certificates for the NY Safe Boating Course.\n|user|: do I have to have Boating safety certificates ?\n|assistant|: In New York, certain individuals are required to have a boating safety certificate. Specifically, anyone operating a Personal Watercraft (JetSki\u2122, Wave Runner\u2122, etc.) must have a boating safety certificate and be at least 14 years of age or older. Starting in 2024, if you are operating any other type of motorized boat, you will need a safety certificate if you were born on or after January 1, 1978. Starting in 2025, all operators of motorized vessels, regardless of age, will be required to have a safety certificate. However, if you are renting a boat, you do not need a safety certificate if you are at least 18 years old, although the livery must demonstrate how to properly use the boat before renting it. Persons under the age of 18 may only rent a motorboat if they hold a safety certificate.\n|user|: I need to register my boat and boat trailer\n|assistant|: You can either register your boat online or call the DMV at (518) 486-9786.

Payment for certificates (both first time and replacement) must be made online at <https://www.ilostmycard.com/>. No cash or personal checks are accepted.

The Coast Guard reports nearly 5,000 boating accidents each year in the United States\u2014causing approximately 700 deaths, 3,000 injuries and $36 million in damage. About 85% of all boating deaths occur on boats where the operator has not completed a boating safety education course.

First, always wear a life jacket and ensure that there are enough life jackets on board for all passengers. Second, familiarize yourself with the boat and its equipment before setting out. Third, check the weather forecast and water conditions before you go boating. Fourth, follow all navigation rules and be aware of other boats, swimmers, and obstacles in the water. Fifth, never operate a boat while under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Sixth, take a boating safety course to learn about safe boating practices and laws. Finally, always file a float plan with someone on shore, so they know your boating plans and can alert authorities if you don't return on time."
