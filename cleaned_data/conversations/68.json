The location can affect how fast your compost dries out or holds water. A closed bin is recommended to keep critters out. If you use a closed bin, add a shovel full of soil from the ground. Keep your bin somewhere convenient to use and access. Step 2: Gather Materials - Browns are higher in carbon, and greens are higher in nitrogen. The optimal ratio is 3 parts brown to 1 part green. Avoid feces from cats and dogs, invasive plants, weed seeds, oil, fats, plastics, or non-organic matter. Gather kitchen waste in a container by your sink. Step 3: Maintain - If you have an open bin, layer some small sticks and twigs at the bottom to help with air and drainage. Layer your browns and greens, imagining you're making a bowl for your greens to lay in the middle and then adding more browns on top. Keep your compost at 40-60% water content, like a wrung out sponge. Turning helps a pile break down faster and ensures oxygen is present. Step 4: Harvest and More! - You will know when your compost is done when it has an earthy smell and looks like rich dark soil. If you do not fully turn the pile, your finished compost will be at the bottom of the pile. If you're running out of browns, shredded newspaper, paper towel, and toilet paper rolls make good brown additions.

Pile conditions within that range will promote rapid decomposition and destroy pathogens and weed seeds. Above that temperature range, beneficial microorganisms cannot survive. Below that range, decomposition will occur more slowly, and pathogens and weed seeds may remain in the final compost. Pile temperatures must remain at 131 degrees Fahrenheit or above for several days to meet standards for reducing pathogens. The exact amount of time depends on the method of composting. Controlling the oxygen, moisture, pile structure, and nutrient balance helps achieve the optimal temperature range in a compost pile.\nModels of Composting\nComposting can take place at a range of scales and locations. Site and facility management can be public, private, or a combination. Materials arrive at composting sites through different collection programs.\nThe fundamentals of composting are the same no matter the size or scale of an operation. However, the volume of materials composted, the types of feedstock, and the composting methods and equipment used may differ. Composting operations that handle large volumes of materials and certain feedstocks - such as biosolids or manures - may have additional permitting or zoning requirements, depending on state and local regulations.\n\nBackyard/Home Composting\nBackyard/home composting occurs in residential settings \u2013 often in a backyard pile or a small, enclosed bin. Vermicomposting, or worm composting, is also an option for home composters. Home composting systems mostly handle food scraps (except for meat, bones, and dairy products) and yard trimmings. By composting at home, households reduce their trash going to the landfill or incinerator and use the compost they produce in their garden, yard, or house plants.

          "text": "Approaches to Composting | US EPA\nWindrows are the most common method of composting in the United States. Windrows can be turned periodically or have perforated pipes underneath them to allow air flow. Small to large volumes and a wide variety of materials can be composted using this method, which makes it adaptable to many scales and sites for composting. Windrow composting often requires equipment such as front-end loaders, excavators, or windrow turners.\nIn-Vessel\nIn-vessel composting can process a variety of organic materials without taking up much space. This method involves feeding materials into a vessel, such as a drum, silo, concrete-lined trench, or similar enclosed equipment. The materials are then mechanically turned or mixed in the vessel with bulking agents like wood chips to ensure aeration. Vessels, also known as bioreactors, vary in size and capacity. A similar composting method that takes place in an enclosed area is an agitated bay system where mixing and aerating equipment moves compost along walled bays or beds as it decomposes and stabilizes.\nWorm Composting (Vermicomposting)\n\n Resources\n \n\nCheck out EPA\u2019s Home Composting page as well as vermicomposting resources from North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension.\n\nWorm composting, or vermicomposting, relies on earthworms and microorganisms to break down organic materials into vermicompost, or worm castings, a high-quality soil amendment. A vermicomposting system can be indoors or outdoors in the shade and sized to match the volume of food scraps put into the system. Vermicomposting can used by households, schools, farms, institutions, and businesses. A properly maintained vermicomposting system does not produce odors or attract pests.\nIt is essential to use a suitable worm species, such as red wrigglers (Eisenia fetida). Worms are kept in a closed bin or system that should be shielded from light and rain, with sufficient air flow, and a way to drain excess liquid. The ideal temperature for a vermicomposting system is 55 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.",

This temperature range promotes rapid decomposition and destroys pathogens and weed seeds.

Paper/cardboard must be kept in a separate recycling bin from plastic/metal/glass containers.\u00a0Where can I get a new recycling bin?\u00a0Residents of Madison County can pick up new recycling bins at their local transfer station, when they are open. Recycling bins are FREE, while supplies last.Will the rain affect my recycling?\u00a0It is okay if your recyclables get wet from the rain. To help keep recyclables dry and to keep recyclables from blowing out of the container, we recommend placing your heavier plastic/metal/glass recycling bin on top of your paper/cardboard recycling bin to weigh everything down and keep the paper dry.Do I need to tarp my waste materials when I drop it off at the Transfer Station or Landfill?Yes! All waste materials including recyclables, trash, and construction/demolition debris should be tarped and tied down in a truck bed. Unsecure items, even if they are bagged, can fall out of the truck bed and create unsafe roads along with litter. Make sure to secure your garbage to help keep Madison County roads safe and clean.Why do I need a punch card and where can I get one?Residents that drop off garbage and other bulky items at our transfer stations need to buy a punch card before visiting. Punch cards are sold at the landfill scale house, village and town clerk offices, and other local businesses across the county. Punch cards are not sold at transfer stations. View a list of local businesses that sell our punch cards. \u00a0Can I recycle plastic items that have a #1-7 on them?Unfortunately, not all plastics can be recycled in our program.",
