          "text": "NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details\nAt this point (about 961 seconds after impact) imaging ended as the spacecraft reoriented itself by 45 degrees to optimize protection from dust damage as it flew by the nucleus. Closest approach to the nucleus was at a distance of about 500 km. At 1270 seconds the crossing of the inner coma was complete and the spacecraft oriented itself to look back at the comet and begin imaging again. At 3000 seconds the spacecraft began playback of data to Earth at 20 to 200 kilobits per second. The comet and spacecraft were about 0.89 AU from Earth and 1.5 AU from the Sun during the encounter. Real time return of selected impactor images and flyby images and spectra were returned to Earth during the encounter. Primary data return took place over the first day after encounter, with a 28 day supplemental data return period. Earth-based observatories also studied the impact. The spacecraft ranged over a distance of 0.93 to 1.56 AU from the Sun during the primary mission. End of primary mission was August 2005. The total budget for the primary mission was $240 million.\n\nEPOXI Extended Mission\n\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended mission which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately 700 km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh) investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley 2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on 4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of roughly 700 km.",

The total flyby bus instrument payload has a mass of 90 kg and will use an average of 92 W during encounter.\n\nThe flyby spacecraft measures approximately 3.2 m x 1.7 m x 2.3 m, is three-axis stabilized and uses a blowdown hydrazine primary propulsion system with 5000 N-s RCS total impulse providing a total delta-V of 190 m/s. Communications with the ground from the flyby bus are via X-band (8.000 MHz) through a 1 meter diameter parabolic dish antenna mounted on a 2-axis gimbal or through a fixed low-gain antenna. Communication between the impactor and flyby spacecraft is in S-band. The uplink data rate will be 125 bps, downlink will be at 175 kbps. Power of 620 W at the encounter is provided by a 7.2 square meter solar array and stored in a small NiH2 battery. The spacecraft control system consists of four hemispherical resonator gyros, two star trackers, reaction wheels, and hydrazine thrusters. Pointing accuracy is 200 microradians with 65 microradian knowledge. Thermal control is achieved by insulating blankets, surface radiators, finishes, and heaters.

Real time return of selected impactor images and flyby images and spectra were returned to Earth during the encounter. Primary data return took place over the first day after encounter, with a 28 day supplemental data return period. Earth-based observatories also studied the impact. The spacecraft ranged over a distance of 0.93 to 1.56 AU from the Sun during the primary mission. End of primary mission was August 2005. The total budget for the primary mission was $240 million.\n\nEPOXI Extended Mission\n\nDeep Impact has been funded for an extended mission which has two parts. The Deep Impact Extended Investigation (DIXI) involved flying by comet 103P/Hartley 2 on 4 November 2010 at a closest approach of approximately 700 km. (The original target was comet Boethin on 5 December 2008) and returning images and data. The Extrasolar Planet Observation and Characterization (EPOCh) investigation used the Deep Impact imaging system to observe nearby bright stars with known large planets to characterize the planets as they orbit behind and in front of the stars and to search other planets in those systems. This phase of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley 2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on 4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of roughly 700 km.",

The spacecraft transferred into a heliocentric orbit and will rendezvous with comet P/Tempel 1 in July 2005. Deep Impact was 880,000 km from the comet on 3 July 2005 moving at a velocity of 10.2 km/s relative to the comet. The projectile was released at this point and shortly after release the flyby spacecraft executed a maneuver to slow down relative to the impactor by 120 m/s and divert by 6 m/s. On 4 July the impactor struck the sunlit side of the comet nucleus 24 hours after release, at 5:52 UT (1:52 a.m. EDT). At 10.2 km/s velocity, the impactor had an impact energy of about 19 gigajoules, and hit at an oblique angle of approximately 25 degrees. Material from the nucleus was ejected into space and the impactor and much of the ejecta was vaporized.\n\nThe flyby spacecraft was approximately 10,000 km away at the time of impact and began imaging 60 seconds before impact. At 600 seconds after impact the spacecraft was about 4000 km from the nucleus and observations of the crater began and continued up to a range of about 700 km, about 50 seconds before closest approach. At this point (about 961 seconds after impact) imaging ended as the spacecraft reoriented itself by 45 degrees to optimize protection from dust damage as it flew by the nucleus. Closest approach to the nucleus was at a distance of about 500 km. At 1270 seconds the crossing of the inner coma was complete and the spacecraft oriented itself to look back at the comet and begin imaging again.

Formally started in NASA's FY 1994 \rbudget, the Discovery program featured small planetary exploration\rspacecraft with focused science goals that could be built in\r36 months or less, for less than $190 million in development costs \rand a total mission cost of less than $299 million. The program has \rexpanded since then, but still concentrates on smaller missions that \rrequire less resources and shorter development times than the larger \r\"flagship\" missions. \r\rThe program encourages the use of new technologies, transfer of these \rtechnologies to the private sector, increased participation of small \rand disadvantaged businesses, the pursuit of innovative ways of doing \rbusiness, and support of the nation's educational initiatives. \rThe objective is to perform high-quality scientific investigations \rwhich will assure continuity in the U.S. solar system exploration \rprogram and enhance general public awareness of, and appreciation \rfor, solar system exploration.\r\r\rSeventeen missions have been selected for the Discovery program so far:\r DAVINCI+ \r- Venus orbiter and atmospheric probe (to be launched 2028-2030) VERITAS \r- Venus orbiter (to be launched 2028-2030) Psyche \r- Asteroid Psyche orbiter (to be launched August 2022) Lucy \r- Trojan asteroid flyby mission (launched 16 October 2021) InSight \r- Mars geophysical lander (launched 5 May 2018) GRAIL A\rand \r\rGRAIL B \r- Lunar gravity orbiters (launched 10 September 2011) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter \r- Lunar surface studies orbiter (launched 18 June 2009) Kepler \r- Exoplanet observation mission (launched 7 March 2009) Dawn \r- Asteroid Vesta and Ceres orbiter (launched 27 September 2007) Deep Impact \r- Mission to Comet Tempel 1 (launched 12 January 2005) MESSENGER \r- Mission to orbit Mercury (launched 3 August 2004) CONTOUR \r- Mission to fly by three comet nuclei (launched 3 July 2002 - failed) Genesis \r- Solar wind sample return mission (launched 8 August 2001) Stardust",

NASA\u2019s reaction was to envision a steady stream of missions to Mars \u2014 all done at cut-rate costs. In fact, the next challenge taken on by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was to fly two missions to Mars for the price of the single Pathfinder mission. Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander both made it to the launch pad, on time and on budget, but were lost upon arrival at Mars, resulting in one of the most difficult periods in the history of JPL. The Breaking Point tells the story of the demise of these two missions and the abrupt end of NASA\u2019s Faster, Better, Cheaper.View episode \u203aEpisode 10: Saving GalileoIf any spacecraft could be said to have had nine lives, it was Galileo. At the time of its launch, this mission to Jupiter was the most sophisticated science spacecraft ever built. But the expectation of great science rewards almost was ruined when the spacecraft\u2019s main antenna refused to unfurl. Saving Galileo is the story of how NASA\u2019s Galileo mission \u2014 designed, built and operated by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory \u2014 was kept alive despite a multitude of technical challenges, including a years-long launch delay after the loss of the space shuttle Challenger and then the devastating failure of its main antenna following the spacecraft\u2019s launch. It is also the story of a tight-knit team of scientists and engineers who were forged by adversity into what many came to call a family.",

The team at \nJohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and its \nmany partner institutions are to be congratulated for \nachieving this historic first in space exploration.\"\n\nDuring its 5-year, 2-billion-mile journey, the NEAR Shoemaker \nmission, which was built and is managed by The Applied \nPhysics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, MD, provided the most \ndetailed profile yet of a small celestial body. It began a \nyearlong orbit of Eros on Feb. 14, 2000, and has collected 10 \ntimes more data than originally planned.\n\nThe data include a detailed shape-model culled from more than \n11 million laser pulses; radar and laser data on Eros' weak \ngravity and solid but cracked interior; X-ray, gamma-ray and \ninfrared readings on its composition and spectral properties; \nand about 160,000 images covering all of the 21-mile-long \nasteroid's bouldered, cratered, dusty terrain.",

      "original_text": "Sure, here's a brief overview of another mission that is part of NASA's Discovery Program - the Kepler Space Telescope:\nThe Kepler Space Telescope is a space observatory launched by NASA in 2009 to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. It was the first mission of NASA's Discovery Program to search for exoplanets using the transit method, where the telescope measures the dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it.\nKepler's primary mission was to survey a portion of the sky in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra, searching for planets in the habitable zone of their host stars, where liquid water could exist on the surface. The mission was highly successful, discovering over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets and thousands of additional planet candidates during its lifetime.\nThe Kepler mission ended in 2018, but its legacy continues through the K2 mission and other exoplanet hunting projects. The data collected by Kepler has significantly advanced our understanding of the prevalence and diversity of exoplanets in the galaxy, and has paved the way for future missions to study these planets in greater detail."
