(NASA images courtesy STEREO Science Center.)\n\nMedium Earth Orbit\nCloser to the Earth, satellites in a medium Earth orbit move more quickly. Two medium Earth orbits are notable: the semi-synchronous orbit and the Molniya orbit.\nThe semi-synchronous orbit is a near-circular orbit (low eccentricity) 26,560 kilometers from the center of the Earth (about 20,200 kilometers above the surface). A satellite at this height takes 12 hours to complete an orbit. As the satellite moves, the Earth rotates underneath it. In 24-hours, the satellite crosses over the same two spots on the equator every day. This orbit is consistent and highly predictable. It is the orbit used by the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.\n\nThe second common medium Earth orbit is the Molniya orbit. Invented by the Russians, the Molniya orbit works well for observing high latitudes. A geostationary orbit is valuable for the constant view it provides, but satellites in a geostationary orbit are parked over the equator, so they don\u2019t work well for far northern or southern locations, which are always on the edge of view for a geostationary satellite. The Molniya orbit offers a useful alternative.\n\nThe Molniya orbit combines high inclination (63.4\u00b0) with high eccentricity (0.722) to maximize viewing time over high latitudes. Each orbit lasts 12 hours, so the slow, high-altitude portion of the orbit repeats over the same location every day and night. Russian communications satellites and the Sirius radio satellites currently use this type of orbit. (Adapted from Fundamentals of Space Systems by Vincent L. Pisacane, 2005.)\n\nThe Molniya orbit is highly eccentric: the satellite moves in an extreme ellipse with the Earth close to one edge.

Many weather and some communications satellites tend to have a high Earth orbit, farthest away from the surface. Satellites that orbit in a medium (mid) Earth orbit include navigation and specialty satellites, designed to monitor a particular region. Most scientific satellites, including NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System fleet, have a low Earth orbit.\n\nOne way of classifying orbits is by altitude. Low Earth orbit starts just above the top of the atmosphere, while high Earth orbit begins about one tenth of the way to the moon. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon)\n\nThe height of the orbit, or distance between the satellite and Earth\u2019s surface, determines how quickly the satellite moves around the Earth. An Earth-orbiting satellite\u2019s motion is mostly controlled by Earth\u2019s gravity. As satellites get closer to Earth, the pull of gravity gets stronger, and the satellite moves more quickly. NASA\u2019s Aqua satellite, for example, requires about 99 minutes to orbit the Earth at about 705 kilometers up, while a weather satellite about 36,000 kilometers from Earth\u2019s surface takes 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4 seconds to complete an orbit. At 384,403 kilometers from the center of the Earth, the Moon completes a single orbit in 28 days.\n\nThe higher a satellite\u2019s orbit, the slower it moves. Certain orbital altitudes have special properties, like a geosynchronous orbit, in which a satellite travels around the Earth exactly once each day. The length of each red arrow in this diagram represents the distance traveled by a satellite in an hour. View animation. (NASA illustration by Robert Simmon.)\n\nChanging a satellite\u2019s height will also change its orbital speed. This introduces a strange paradox. If a satellite operator wants to increase the satellite\u2019s orbital speed, he can\u2019t simply fire the thrusters to accelerate the satellite. Doing so would boost the orbit (increase the altitude), which would slow the orbital speed. Instead, he must fire the thrusters in a direction opposite to the satellite\u2019s forward motion, an action that on the ground would slow a moving vehicle.",

A satellite in this orbit spends about two-thirds of its 12-hour period over one hemisphere, making it suitable for communications in the far north or south.\n- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO): This orbit is closer to the Earth and moves more quickly than LEO. A notable MEO is the semi-synchronous orbit used by GPS satellites, which is nearly circular and about 20,200 kilometers above the Earth's surface. Satellites in this orbit take 12 hours to complete an orbit and pass over the same two spots on the equator every day.\n- Low Earth Orbit (LEO): This is a nearly circular orbit close to the Earth, with an altitude typically below 2,000 kilometers. Most scientific satellites and many weather satellites are in LEO. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, for example, has a low orbital inclination (35\u00b0) to focus on monitoring rainfall in the tropics. Another type of LEO is a nearly polar orbit, where the satellite moves around the Earth from pole to pole, taking about 99 minutes to complete an orbit.\nPlease let me know if you need more information on any of these orbits."

This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.Orbit and RotationAs Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.MoonsEarth is the only planet that has a single moon.\u00a0Our Moon\u00a0is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks.",

It's 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit (5,500 degrees Celsius) at the surface, and 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15,000,000 degrees Celsius) in the core. Yikes!\nOur Sun is pretty impressive, but how does it compare to other stars? There are billions more stars in the Milky Way galaxy - the galaxy we call home. And there are many, many more in the rest of the universe. Is our Sun special?\n\nThe size of our sun\nIt turns out that our Sun is an average sized star. There are bigger stars, and there are smaller stars. We have found stars that are 100 times bigger in diameter than our sun. Truly, those stars are enormous. We have also seen stars that are just one tenth the size of our sun.\n\nSuns with friends\nOur Sun is a little unusual because it doesn't have any friends. It's just one Sun surrounded by planets, asteroids, comets, and dwarf planets. But solar systems can have more than one sun. In fact, that's often the case. More than half of all stars are in multiple star systems. That means the solar system has two or more suns in it.",

Though it is a smallish star, most stars in our galaxy are smaller, and less massive. Our sun is, like most stars in our galaxy and probably most stars, a main sequence star which means it generates its energy by thermonuclear fusion resulting in the release of gamma ray photons during a process in the core where hydrogen nuclei (protons) are fused together to form helium nuclei. This process, converting hydrogen to helium, driven by the enormous internal pressure of the sun's mass (2x1030 kg or over 300,000 times the mass of the Earth!) is what makes a star a star. Since everything forms from a roughly basic and somewhat consistent cosmic menu of elements (75% H, 24% He,...) the variable that determines whether you get an asteroid, a planet, or a star is mass. Enough mass creates enough pressure to start this fusion process and create a star. Not enough mass and you have a failed star or planet (even less mass and you get an object that is not round at all). It's that simple. The sun formed around the same time that the planets formed, from a molecular cloud - remnant of a super nova explosion. The sun is very old, by human standards but only middle aged by stellar standards, about 4.6 billion years old and it should be around in a more or less similar form for maybe another 5 billion years.\nIt might be interesting to note that considering only classical (or Newtonian) physics, the physics that you learned in high school, the physics that defined reality for around 400 years, since Isaac Newton gave his three laws of motion, the sun and all the stars cannot shine. Classical physics does not allow two similarly charged protons to bond. In addition, matter - energy equivalency (E=mc2) was not known until the early 1900's. So before Einstein and before quantum physics, there was no plausible explanation for how the sun generated its energy. Want to know more? Read \"On the age of mostly everything\".",

The age, size and shape of the universe have been mapped based on the primordial radiation left by the big bang. And it has been learned that most of the matter in the universe is dark and invisible, and the universe is not only expanding, but accelerating in an unexpected way.For the long term future, the Astrophysics goals will be guided based on the results of the 2020 Decadal survey Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s. It identifies the most compelling science goals and presents an ambitious program of ground- and space-based activities for future investment. The report recommends critical near-term actions to support the foundations of the profession as well as the technologies and tools needed to carry out the science.In 2012 the Astrophysics Implementation Plan was released which describes the activities currently being undertaken in response to the decadal survey recommendations within the current budgetary constraints. The plan was updated in 2014, 2016, and in 2018.The Astrophysics roadmap Enduring Quests, Daring Visions was developed by a task force of the Astrophysics Subcommittee (APS) in 2013.",

It is responsible for keeping our feet on the ground and holding Earth in its orbit around the Sun.According to the general theory of relativity, gravity can be understood as bends and curves in the fabric of space-time that affect the motions of galaxies, stars, planets, and even light. Anything with mass makes a dent in space-time, causing objects to be attracted to each other.Gravity is an attractive force that draws two objects together. Its strength approximately increases with the masses of the two objects but decreases with the square of the distance between them. That means that if the Moon were twice its current distance from Earth, the gravitational tug between the two would be just one fourth of what it is now.Despite being the weakest force, gravity works across infinite distances, making it responsible for the formation of the universe's structure.Electromagnetic ForceNASAOur television sets are powered by electromagnetism. Light carries this force, which illuminates our houses at night, keeps electrons in orbit around atomic nuclei, and allows chemical compounds to form.As the name implies, electromagnetism is the force that includes both electricity and magnetism. They are intertwined \u2014 a moving electric field produces a magnetic field, and vice versa.Like gravity, the strength of electromagnetism drops off with the square of the distance between objects and works at infinite range. However, electromagnetism only comes into play for charged objects, and whether it attracts or repels depends on the charges of each. Two negative or positive charges repel each other; one of each attracts.While electromagnetism is stronger than gravity, it is often balanced out in large objects by the equal numbers of positive and negative charges that form neutral atoms. For example, Earth has a magnetic field due to electric currents in its liquid core; however, Earth itself is electrically neutral.Strong Nuclear ForceNASANuclear forces affect our daily lives, but they work on distances smaller than atoms.The strong nuclear force, or strong force for short, holds together the building blocks of atoms. It always attracts and works at two different size scales in atoms.",

Or really the entire universe (not just the matter in it) was one spot.Don't spend too much time considering a mission to visit the spot where the universe was born, though, as a person cannot visit the place where the Big Bang happened.

Much of the observable matter in the universe takes the form of individual atoms of hydrogen, which is the simplest atomic element, made of only a proton and an electron (if the atom also contains a neutron, it is instead called deuterium). Two or more atoms sharing electrons is a molecule. Many trillions of atoms together is a dust particle. Smoosh a few tons of carbon, silica, oxygen, ice, and some metals together, and you have an asteroid. Or collect 333,000 Earth masses of hydrogen and helium together, and you have a Sun-like star.For the sake of practicality, humans categorize clumps of matter based on their attributes.

It is the idea that the universe began as just a single point, then expanded and stretched to grow as large as it is right now\u2014and it is still stretching!\r\n\t\n\nWhat's This Big Bang All About?\nIn 1927, an astronomer named Georges Lema\u00eetre had a big idea. He said that a very long time ago, the universe started as just a single point. He said the universe stretched and expanded to get as big as it is now, and that it could keep on stretching.\n\nWhat an Idea!\nThe universe is a very big place, and it\u2019s been around for a very long time. Thinking about how it all started is hard to imagine.\n\nSome More Information\nJust two years later, an astronomer named Edwin Hubble noticed that other galaxies were moving away from us. And that\u2019s not all. The farthest galaxies were moving faster than the ones close to us.\n\nThis meant that the universe was still expanding, just like Lema\u00eetre thought. If things were moving apart, it meant that long ago, everything had been close together. \n\nEverything we can see in our universe today\u2014stars, planets, comets, asteroids\u2014they weren't there at the beginning. Where did they come from?\n\nA Tiny, Hot Beginning\nWhen the universe began, it was just hot, tiny particles mixed with light and energy. It was nothing like what we see now. As everything expanded and took up more space, it cooled down.\nThe tiny particles grouped together. They formed atoms. Then those atoms grouped together. Over lots of time, atoms came together to form stars and galaxies.\nThe first stars created bigger atoms and groups of atoms. That led to more stars being born. At the same time, galaxies were crashing and grouping together.",

      "original_text": "The question about when the universe began is complex and depends on the cosmological model one adheres to. According to the Big Bang theory, the current leading explanation in cosmology, the universe began around 13.8 billion years ago. However, it's important to note that this is a subject of ongoing research and debate in the scientific community."
