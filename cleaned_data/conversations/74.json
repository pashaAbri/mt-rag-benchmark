Concepts like how certain components are connected or how access works help you in understanding how to set up your account.\n\nThe following diagram contains two main concepts for the components in the account hierarchy that are important to understand. The use of the solid lines and the dotted lines help illustrate that some components are contained within others, for example, users are added to access groups. However, some components interact with others for providing access instead of membership. For example, users are given access to resource groups but are not members of a resource group the same way they are for access groups.\n\nZoom\n\n![A diagram that shows the components in an account, including services, users, and the subcomponents of each.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/4d8c6eec891cff72b666dc24bd3211810c77fb42/account/images/account_diagram.svg)\n\nFigure 1. A diagram that shows the components in an account, including services, users, and the subcomponents of each.\n\nUsers\n: Users are invited to the account and given access to the resources in the account.\n\nService IDs\n: A service ID identifies a service or application similar to how a user ID identifies a user. You can use a service ID that you create to enable an application outside of IBM Cloud access to your services. You can assign specific access policies to the service ID that restrict permissions for using specific services, or even combine permissions for accessing different services. Since service IDs are not tied to a specific user, if a user happens to leave an organization and is deleted from the account, the service ID remains, ensuring that your application or service stays up and running.

In addition, the most relevant [control requirements](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-aboutframework-control-requirements) are provided.\n\n\n\n1.

For more information, see [Create your account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-startedaccount-gs-create).\n\nIt is highly recommended that you use a functional ID that is owned by your company rather than an employee's personal ID. A functional ID is a company-owned email address (such as ibm-cloud-admin@domain.com) used to represent a functional user.

Within an enterprise, you create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts, with billing and payments for all accounts managed at the enterprise level.\n\nWhen compared to using multiple stand-alone accounts, enterprises offer the following key benefits:\n\n\n\n* Centralized account management: View your entire enterprise hierarchy at a glance, without needing to switch accounts. You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view. Your subscription credit is pooled and shared among accounts in the enterprise.\n* Top-down usage reporting: From your enterprise account, you can view usage of all accounts in your enterprise, which is organized by account group.\n\n\n\n\n\n Watch and learn \n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nYour IBM Cloud account is your home for collaboration in the cloud. As you scale up your workloads, you might find that you're managing multiple IBM Cloud accounts. For example, your company might have many teams, each with one or more of their own accounts for development, testing, and production environments. Or, you might isolate certain workloads in separate accounts to meet security or compliance guidelines. As the number of accounts grows, it can become more difficult to track resource usage and associated costs.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises offer a simpler way to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple accounts. Within an enterprise, you can create a multi-tiered hierarchy of accounts by adding new or existing accounts and nesting them in account groups. How you structure your enterprise is up to you. For example, for a large organization, you might organize your accounts by geography, or by department. You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise. Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place.",

Enter your company's domain, such as examplecorp.com.\n4. Review the information about the impact to your account, and select I understand the impact to my account. Then, click Create. The account is now permanently part of the enterprise and can't be removed.\n\n\n\nAfter your enterprise is created, you are directed to the enterprise dashboard. From here, you can view the enterprise details, accounts, users, and billing information. Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from. Users can continue working with resources in the account unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create an enterprise structure with account groups \n\nUse account groups to [organize related accounts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize).

Each account in an enterprise can contain resources in resource groups. Account groups can't contain resources. For more information, see [Managing resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manage_resource).\n\nZoom\n\n![A diagram that shows that resources are contained in accounts in the enterprise.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/d4595e5202a9a27767cf034e81b038cdf772e0d5/secure-enterprise/images/enterprise-resources.svg)\n\nFigure 3. Resources in an enterprise\n\nAs with all accounts, resources are tied to the resource group and account in which they're created, so they can't be moved between accounts in the enterprise. However, the enterprise's flexible account structure means you can move resources within the enterprise by moving the accounts that contain them.\n\n\n\n\n\n Top-down usage reporting \n\nFrom the enterprise account, you can view resource usage from all accounts in the enterprise. Starting at the enterprise level, you see estimated usage costs that are broken down by account and account groups. You can navigate down within the enterprise structure to see the costs within each level.",

Starting at the enterprise level, you can navigate within the enterprise structure to see the estimated usage costs within each account or account group. At the account level, enterprise users can view costs for each type of resource or service in the account.\n\nEnterprise administrators can provide granular access to users so that they can view usage only for certain account groups or accounts. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team.\n\n\n\n* You give your financial officer access to view the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department.\n* You give each department lead access to view usage for everything in their department's account group.\n* You give each team lead access to view only the accounts in their team's account group.\n\n\n\nBecause access in the enterprise is separate from access in each account, enterprise users can't automatically manage resources within the child accounts. Similarly, users in each account can continue to view their past and current usage from the Usage page regardless of whether they have enterprise access.\n\nYou can view usage from the Usage page in the console, from the CLI, or from the Enterprise Usage Reports API. For more information, see [Viewing usage in an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-enterprise-usage).\n\n\n\n\n\n Invoicing and payments \n\nUsage in the enterprise is invoiced through the enterprise account. As with all billable accounts, usage is invoiced monthly, and the invoice is due on the billing date for your account. During each billing cycle, a single invoice with the usage costs from all accounts is made available in the enterprise account. The invoice contains costs for all platform and infrastructure usage as a single-line item in your invoice.",

The accounts and account groups that you can view usage for depend on your assigned access.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises enable you to centrally manage multiple IBM Cloud accounts. As an enterprise user, you can keep an eye on resource usage and the associated costs for any account in the enterprise. See [What is an enterprise?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-what-is-enterprise) for more information.\n\n\n\n Required access for viewing enterprise usage \n\nIn an enterprise, access to usage information is controlled by the Enterprise service. To view usage information, users must be invited to the enterprise account and have the Usage Reports Viewer, Editor, or Administrator role on the Enterprise service. The Usage Reports Viewer role provides access only to viewing usage reports, while the Editor and Administrator roles enable additional enterprise management actions. In keeping with security best practices, assign the least amount of access that is needed for the user to complete their task. For more information, see [Enterprise actions and roles](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-servicesenterprise-account-management).\n\nYou can give users granular access so that they can view usage for a certain account or account group. For example, say that your enterprise has account groups for each department, and each department has account groups for each team. You can scope the access so that each enterprise user can see only the information that is needed to fulfill their job role.\n\n\n\n* Your financial officer needs to view usage for the entire enterprise so that they can track and recover costs for each department, but they don't need to create accounts or account groups. Assign them the Usage Reports Viewer role for the enterprise.\n* Each department lead needs to view usage for their department, and they also need to create and manage accounts and account groups for their teams. Assign each department lead the Editor role for their department's account group.\n* Each team lead needs to view their team's usage, but you want them to get department approval to add new accounts to their team.",
