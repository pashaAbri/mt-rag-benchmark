Each method of an SDK SHOULD correspond to exactly one operation of the underlying API, and this relationship should be clear from design of the API.\n\nOperations whose functionality is fully supported by a related operation SHOULD be omitted. This can occur, for example, when an operation is exposed with both a GET and an POST method, where the GET offers a subset of the features of the POST but with a simpler interface.\n\n\n\n\n\n Methods \n\nMethods MUST employ a flexible parameter-passing design that allows optional parameters to be added to a method without causing incompatibility with applications using the prior version of the method.\n\nIn some languages this can be accomplished using standard language features like default parameter values, but in other languages (e.g. Java) the method parameters must be encapsulated into an \"options\" object.\n\n\n\n\n\n Streaming \n\nFor a language/runtime that supports stream value types:\n\n\n\n* The SDK SHOULD allow any potentially large input value to a method to be supplied as a stream.\n* The SDK SHOULD allow the result of a method to be returned as a stream if that value may be large.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Asynchronous method calls \n\nThe SDK MUST support asynchronous invocation of any method that performs a network operation. The SDK SHOULD support synchronous or pseudo-synchronous (e.g. async/await) invocation of methods that perform network operation in languages where this method style is idiomatic.\n\n\n\n\n\n Instrumentation \n\nThe SDK SHOULD be instrumented so that relevant usage data can be collected by the service.",

After the build is finished, add BMSCore.framework to your project by following [Step 3](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthagegetting-started) in the Carthage instructions.\n\nFor apps that are built with Swift 2.3, use the carthage update --toolchain com.apple.dt.toolchain.Swift_2_3 command. Otherwise, use the carthage update command.\n\n\n\n3. Import the BMSCore module.\n\nimport BMSCore\n4. Initialize the BMSClient class by using the following code.\n\nPlace the initialization code in the application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) method of your app delegate, or in a location that works best for your project.\n\nBMSClient.sharedInstance.initialize(bluemixRegion: BMSClient.Region.usSouth) // Make sure that you point to your region\n\nYou must initialize the BMSClient with the bluemixRegion parameter. In the initializer, the bluemixRegion value specifies which IBM Cloud deployment you're using, for example, BMSClient.Region.usSouth, BMSClient.Region.unitedKingdom, or BMSClient.Region.sydney.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Initializing your Cordova app \n\n\n\n1.",

However, I am not aware of any particular limitations.\n|user|: I meant the issues that may arise when installing it with CocoaPods. \n|assistant|: I am not aware of any particular limitations.\n|user|: No, there is a warning that comes up when installing it from CocoaPods.\n|assistant|: Yes, you are correct. After installation with CocoaPods, when you open your project workspace, you might get the following warning when building: \"Use Legacy Swift Language Version (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.\" This is caused if CocoaPods does not update the Swift version in the Pods project.\n|user|: Can I just not use CocoaPods?\n|assistant|: If you do not want to use CocoaPods, you can install mobile SDK with Carthage, or you can install mobile SDK from source code.  \n|user|: What are the instructions to do it using Carthage?\n|assistant|: You can install mobile SDK with Carthage as follows. Create a file in the project directory for your app and name it Cartfile. Put the following line in the file: github \"openwhisk/openwhisk-client-swift.git\" > 0.3.0 Or latest version From the command line, type carthage update --platform ios. Carthage downloads and builds the SDK, creates a directory that is called Carthage in the project directory for your app, and puts an OpenWhisk.framework file inside Carthage/build/iOS. You must then add OpenWhisk.framework file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project.\n|user|: What is the latest version of Carthage and where can I donwload it?\n|assistant|: I do not have information about that.\n|user|: Ah, I'd better go to Google ..."
