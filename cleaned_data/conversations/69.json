Therefore, you can choose a method that best fits your game design.\n|user|: any sample setting?\n|assistant|: There is no specific sample setting provided. However, for the Mars Sample Collection Video Game, you are encouraged to study the backdrop images closely and identify areas that look interesting to place sample tubes in those spots.  Develop code to create a scoring system. Increase the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n|user|: How to make the game interesting \n|assistant|: To make the game more interesting, you can consider adding various features such as: 1.  Increase the complexity of the terrain or add more hazards from steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly.  2. Specify a landing site by creating scripts that place the rover at a certain location at the beginning of the game.  3.  Let others play it and suggest improvements.\n|user|: sprite the sprite of bevarage?\n|assistant|: It seems like there might be a typo in your question.

You will use mirrors to move the laser and avoid obstacles to get the data back to Earth. Each level has new challenges and your ultimate goal is to build a communication network and synchronize, or match, the time on atomic clocks.\n\nAbout the mission\nOptical communication uses lasers to send data with a type of light that we can\u2019t see, called infrared light. Since the 1950s, NASA missions have used a different type of waves, called radio waves, to send data to and from space. With current radio wave communications, it takes about nine weeks to send a complete map of Mars back to Earth. With lasers, it only takes about nine days!\nOptical communication is very useful for space missions because data can be sent faster and more securely. Optical communication systems are also smaller, weigh less, and use less power. A smaller size means more room for science instruments, and using less power means less of a drain of the spacecraft\u2019s batteries. These are all very important details for NASA when designing and creating mission concepts.

Get to know the missions In this game, you\u2019ll lead a mission to explore some of the most interesting environments in our solar system including the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter's moon Europa. Before getting started, read on to learn about some of the current and future NASA missions exploring the same destinations you will soon encounter with your fleet of spacecraft. NASA\u2019s Artemis program calls for sending the first woman and next man to the surface of the Moon by 2024. It also seeks to establish a permanent and sustainable presence on the Moon. The agency will use what we learn on the Moon to prepare for humanity's next giant leap \u2013 sending astronauts to Mars.On Mars, Perseverance, NASA's most advanced Mars rover to date, is taking the next steps in our exploration of the Red Planet. Only the fifth NASA rover to land on Mars, Perseverance is building on the work and scientific discoveries of its predecessors by searching for evidence of ancient microbial life on the Red Planet.In the near future, NASA plans to take its search for life even farther into the solar system to Jupiter's ocean moon Europa. This small moon contains more water beneath its icy shell than all of Earth's oceans combined. NASA's Europa Clipper mission, currently in development, is designed to orbit Europa, make up-close observations, and investigate whether the icy moon has conditions suitable for life.About the image: From left to right: An artistic depiction of the Artemis program's Gateway space station; a selfie taken by the Perseverance rover on Mars; and an artistic depiction of the Europa Clipper spacecraft orbiting Jupiter's moon Europa.

Add a countdown timer NASA\u2019s missions to Mars and other destinations have a planned life expectancy. Some missions, including every Mars rover to date, have been extended and operated beyond their planned mission life expectancy, while others experience problems that shorten their mission. You can create a timer that counts down to the end of the mission and ends the game. Your timer should not be so short that the game is unplayable or unwinnable, but it should not be so long that there is no challenge to playing the game. As a bonus, you can create code to extend or shorten the planned mission time.\nTasks\n\nCreate a timer that counts from a set time down to zero. Hint: Create a Time variable that you can program to change. (See example image.)\nMake gameplay stop when the timer reaches zero.\nMake a \u201cMission Over\u201d message appear when the timer reaches zero.\nMake the timer start over when a player clicks the green flag to restart the game.\nBonus: Develop code that will increase or decrease the amount of time on the timer by one or two seconds at random.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n5.

But the science they collect is valuable, and some discoveries may be more exciting, interesting, or important than others. To determine how well players are doing while playing your game, you can develop a scoring system that includes points earned for collecting sample tubes. How points are totaled is up to you. You could also program your game to reduce point totals in certain scenarios (see Step 6, for example).\nTasks\n\nDevelop code to create a scoring system.\nIncrease the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n6.

You could, for example, increase the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected. However, it does not provide specific details on how to total the points. Therefore, you can choose a method that best fits your game design.\n|user|: any sample setting?\n|assistant|: There is no specific sample setting provided. However, for the Mars Sample Collection Video Game, you are encouraged to study the backdrop images closely and identify areas that look interesting to place sample tubes in those spots.  Develop code to create a scoring system. Increase the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n|user|: How to make the game interesting \n|assistant|: To make the game more interesting, you can consider adding various features such as: 1.  Increase the complexity of the terrain or add more hazards from steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly.  2. Specify a landing site by creating scripts that place the rover at a certain location at the beginning of the game.  3.  Let others play it and suggest improvements.\n|user|: sprite the sprite of bevarage?\n|assistant|: It seems like there might be a typo in your question.  A Mars fetch rover sprite is a sample collection tube.  \n|user|: Of course I knew it!  just teasing, sorry.  How to scripts sprite?\n|assistant|: To script the sprite, create a new sprite by moving the mouse over Choose a sprite in the Sprite window and selecting Upload sprite. Choose the Mars fetch rover sprite image.  Then, you can use the available blocks in Scratch to create scripts that control the sprite's behavior. For example, make the sample tube sprites disappear when they are visited by the rover, or  reappear when players click the green flag to restart the game.  Use motion blocks to make the sprite move, turn, or change costumes. You can also use control blocks to add loops, conditionals, or variables to your scripts.\n|user|: other games?\n|assistant|: There are several other games available on the NASA Space Place website that you might find interesting.
