      "original_text": "It seems like you're asking for a continuation of the previous topic related to safe driving practices. Here are some tips for motorcyclists and motorists:\nTips for Motorcyclists:\n1. Protect your melon! Always wear a DOT-approved helmet and eye protection. \"Novelty Helmets\" are not approved and offer little protection to the rider in a crash. In fact, they are illegal to wear on New York roadways.\n2. Always wear high-quality riding gear designed to protect the rider during a fall. This includes over-the-ankle boots, full-finger gloves with padding, in addition to jackets and pants with armor protection at impact points.\n3. Be conspicuous. Wear high visibility vests, garments with reflector features, and accessories to boost your visibility to other drivers.\n4. Maintain your motorcycle properly. Ensure all of your lights and horn are working and both mirrors are adjusted. Make sure your tires are properly inflated and have legal tread depth. Remember, motorcycles maintain a smaller tire contact patch on the roadway when compared to other vehicles. Good traction is a key component to safe handling and braking in normal and adverse situations.\n5. Maintain a high level of awareness. Scan the roadway constantly for dangers and ride alert. If you are tired, take a break and re-energize to boost your concentration.\n6. Drive sober. Never ride impaired by alcohol or drugs and discourage other riders from making a bad choice.\nTips for Other Motorists:\n1. Share the road. Motorcycles are vehicles with the same rights and privileges as any other vehicle on the roadway.\n2. Always check your blind spots before changing lanes. Motorcycles are much smaller than other vehicles and can easily go unnoticed.\n3. Allow extra space when following a motorcycle. Motorcycles can stop more quickly than other vehicles, so it's essential to maintain a safe following distance.\n4. Use your signals. Signaling your intentions can help prevent crashes and keep everyone on the road safe.\n5. Stay focused on the road and your surroundings. Avoid distractions such as cell phones and other activities that can take your attention away from driving.\n6. Drive sober. Never drive impaired by alcohol"

Recognizing the need to reduce the carnage on the nation\u2019s roads, Congress passed the National Highway Safety Act, which provides for federal traffic safety funds to states.\nIn 1967, the California Traffic Safety Program (TSP) was enacted by the Legislature to provide authority for the State to implement the requirements of the national legislation. Subsequently, the Governor delegated authority to administer the TSP to the Secretary of the Business, Transportation and Housing (BT&H) Agency. In turn, the Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) was created in the BT&H Agency to administer the TSP under the direction of the Governor\u2019s Highway Safety Representative.\nSince that time, the work and influence of OTS has grown and spread. In the early days, funding, expertise, and results were scarce. Over the years, OTS staff became skilled professionals, programs expanded, and local authorities embraced the traffic safety message. Interest grew, priorities areas were established, and traffic deaths and injuries began to fall.\nEach year a Highway Safety Plan (HSP) is developed to reflect current needs as well as detailing the planned use of federal funds. The HSP identifies problems, specific performance measures, proposed solutions, time frames and fiscal information on continuing and planned new grants which are designed to mitigate traffic safety problems. OTS\u2019 role in this cycle has proven invaluable as it provides a vital link among Federal, State and local functions.\nOTS became the national leader in innovative programs to save lives on its roadways. It has established results driven best-practices and encouraged new strategies. While the state\u2019s population continues to grow, traffic deaths and injuries are falling.\n\nLegislative Bill Establishing the Office of Traffic Safety\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nBack to Top\n\nContact OTS\n\nConditions of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSite Map\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nX\n\nYouTube\n\nCopyright \u00a9 State of California\nPowered by: CAWeb Publishing Service",

These surveys include an analysis of roadway conditions, accident records, and the prevailing speed, or 85th percentile, of prudent drivers. If speed limit signs are posted for a lower limit than is considered reasonable, many drivers will simply ignore the signs. At the same time, other drivers will stay within the posted limits. This generally increases the conflicts between faster and slower drivers, reduces the gaps in traffic through which crossings could be made safely and increases the difficulty for pedestrians to judge the speed, of approaching vehicles. Studies have shown that where uniformity of speed is not maintained, accidents generally increase. \n\n2.\nWhat flood zone is my property in?\n\nThe entire City is a C Zone (no floods).

They are not always an asset to traffic control. In some instances, total accidents and severe injuries increased after signals were installed. Usually, in such instances, right angle collisions were reduced by the traffic signals, but the total number of collisions, especially the rear-end type, increased.There are times when the installation of signals results in an increase in the number of pedestrian accidents. Many pedestrians feel secure with a painted crosswalk and a red light between them and an approaching vehicle. The motorist, on the other hand, is not always so quick to recognize these \"barriers.\"When can a traffic signal be an asset instead of a liability to safety?",

The facts indicate otherwise. Research conducted in many parts of this country over a span of several decades has shown that drivers are influenced more by the appearance of the highway itself and the prevailing traffic conditions than by the posted speed limit. California's Basic Speed Law requires that:\"No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is responsible or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property.\"Under California law, the maximum speed limit for any passenger vehicle is now 65 miles per hour (MPH). All other speed limits are called prima facie limits, which \"on the face of it\" are safe and prudent under normal conditions. Certain prima facie limits are established by law and include the 25 MPH limit in business and residential districts, the 15 MPH limit in alleys, at blind intersections and blind railroad crossings and a part-time 25 MPH limit in school zones when children are going to and from school. These speeds are not always posted but all California motorists are required to know these 10, 20, and 30 mile per hour speed laws.Intermediate speed limits between 25 and 55 miles per hour may be established by local authorities on the basis of traffic engineering surveys. These surveys include an analysis of roadway conditions, accident records, and the prevailing speed, or 85th percentile, of prudent drivers.",

          "text": "FAQs \u2022 Auburn, CA \u2022 CivicEngage\nA pedestrian signal allows a safer way for pedestrians to cross the street at signalized intersections. The pedestrian signal, when activated, provides time for the pedestrian to enter the street on the steady \"Walk\" and to finish crossing the street on the flashing \"Don't Walk\" signal. The pedestrian signal is normally activated by a push-button that tells the signal controller that there is a pedestrian who wishes to cross the street.\t\n\n4.\nHow much will this citation cost? \n\r\nThe court sets all fines and will inform you by mail regarding the amount owed, or will do so in court on your court date. \t\n\n5.\nMay I attend traffic school to take care of this citation? \n\r\nDMV allows drivers to attend court-approved traffic school once every 18 months, and drivers must pay all the applicable fines and fees for their citations, plus the additional amount for the school itself.However, by attending traffic school the violation will not be added to your record.\t\n\n6.\nMay I pay my traffic citation by mail? \n\r\nYes. The court will mail out a notice but does not guarantee its delivery. If you receive a notice in the mail, you may pay the fine via mail. Otherwise, you need to appear in court on the date and time listed on the citation.\t\n\n7.\nMay I contest this citation? \n\r\nYes. Appear in court on the date and time listed on your citation, and explain to the judge that you wish to contest the citation.\t\n\n8.\nWhat if the court does not send me a letter after I get a traffic citation? \n\r\nIf you don't get a letter, you must appear in court. The court date, time and location will be indicated on the bottom of your citation.\t\n\n9.\nWhat is red light running?\n\r\nA violation occurs when a motorist deliberately enters an intersection after the signal light has turned red. Motorists who are already in an intersection when the signal changes to red - while waiting to turn, for example - are not red light running.\t\n\n10.\nIs red light running a serious problem?\n\r\nDrivers who run red lights are responsible for an estimated 260,000 crashes in the U.S. each year, killing over 800 people each year.",

Pedestrians are also required to use sidewalks when available and should walk on the left side of crosswalks or intersections facing oncoming traffic if there are no sidewalks."
