How do I know if objects and events described here are visible where I live? Most skywatching phenomena featured on these webpages and in our What's Up videos are visible for observers across the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere (that is, from about 25\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 north latitude). Plenty of these highlights are also visible from other locations farther north and south.If an object like a star or planet appears high overhead for the U.S. mainland, then it will also appear high overhead across much of Europe, the Mediterranean and Middle East, and Eastern Asia. These regions share the same range of latitudes, so their view of the night sky is similar.We recommend using skywatching apps for mobile devices and computers for determining if something can be seen from your location, and when to look for it. They enable you to enter your location on Earth and see the sky as it will look on a particular date and time.How big is a \"degree\" when describing how close objects appear in the sky? A degree is about the with of your little finger held at arm's length. Most of us are familiar with the idea that there are 360 degrees in a circle, and that making a 180-degree turn is to face the opposite direction. If you imagine the sky as a sphere with the stars fixed onto it and pick any point, and draw a circle all the way around the sky until you return to that point, you will have rotated through 360 degrees. To approximate 5 degrees, hold up your three middle fingers on one hand.",

It's a combined effect of scattered light from these things that manifests as a glow in the night sky that makes it difficult to observe fainter stars and the Milky Way.

It is also recommended to use special filters over the lenses of cameras, telescopes, or binoculars when looking at the Sun.

This is called a partial eclipse and might look as if a bite has been taken out of the Sun. It is important to keep your eclipse glasses on during all parts of the partial solar eclipse. The visible part of the Sun is tens of thousands of times brighter than what you see during totality. You can also use a pinhole camera to view the eclipse. An approximately 115-mile-wide strip known as the path of totality is where the shadow of the Moon, or umbra, will fall on Earth. Inside this path, totality will be visible starting about 65 to 75 minutes after the eclipse begins. If you are in the path of totality, it is safe to take off your eclipse glasses and look at the total eclipse only during totality. Be sure to put your glasses back on before the total phase ends and the surface of the Sun becomes visible again. Your viewing location during the eclipse will determine how long you can see the eclipse in totality. In the U.S., viewers can expect to see 3.5 to 5.5 minutes of totality. After totality ends, a partial eclipse will continue for 60 to 80 minutes, ending when the edge of the Moon moves off of the disk of the Sun. For more information about the start of the partial eclipse, the start and duration of totality, and the percentage of the Sun eclipsed outside the path of totality, find your location on this eclipse map. On April 8, NASA Television will host a live broadcast featuring expert commentary and views from telescopes along the path of totality. Tune into the broadcast from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. PDT (1 to 4 p.m. EDT) on the day of the eclipse. Join NASA as a total solar eclipse moves across North America on April 8. Tune in from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. PDT (1 to 4 p.m. EDT) for live views from across the path, expert commentary, live demos, and more.",

Remember to also use special filters over the lenses of cameras, telescopes, or binoculars when looking at the Sun. The only time during a solar eclipse when it\u2019s safe to look at the Sun without eclipse glasses is during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun\u2019s bright face. Ask an adult for help looking at the Sun.\n\nTotal solar eclipses happen somewhere around the world about once a year. But because the Moon casts a fairly small shadow, these eclipses can only be seen from a small area on Earth each time.\nOther things can also pass between us and the Sun and block some of its light. When this happens, it is called a transit. Different things like planets, comets, spacecraft, and even birds can transit the Sun.\n\nHow to Play\nThe goal of this game is to snap photos of eclipses and objects that transit the Sun. Here\u2019s how to play on your desktop:\n\nUse your cursor to center on objects passing in front of the Sun.\nPress the spacebar to take a picture.\nTo take a close-up picture you can zoom in and out using your laptop trackpad or scroll wheel on your mouse, or by pressing the W and S buttons on your keyboard.\nTo change the camera filter and get a different view of the Sun, press the A and D keys.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nSince the Sun is very bright, transiting objects look like dark shapes. During the game, you might notice some objects are bigger than others. That\u2019s because the objects are different sizes and different distances from you. Objects that are far away, like Mercury, look smaller \u2014 even though Mercury is an entire planet that\u2019s even larger than the Moon. Objects that are closer to Earth \u2013 or even in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, like a plane \u2013 look bigger.

          "text": "Five Tips from NASA for Photographing a Total Solar Eclipse - NASA\nTo take images when the Sun is partially eclipsed, you\u2019ll need to use a special solar filter to protect your camera, just as you\u2019ll need a pair of solar viewing glasses (also called eclipse glasses) to protect your eyes. However, at totality, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun, make sure to remove the filter so you can see the Sun\u2019s outer atmosphere \u2013 the corona.\n#2 \u2013 Any Camera Is a Good Camera\nTaking a stunning photo has more to do with the photographer than the camera. Whether you have a high-end DLSR or a camera phone, you can take great photos during the eclipse; after all, the best piece of equipment you can have is a good eye and a vision for the image you want to create. If you don\u2019t have a telephoto zoom lens, focus on taking landscape shots and capture the changing environment.\nHaving a few other pieces of equipment can also come in handy during the eclipse. Using a tripod can help you stabilize the camera and avoid taking blurry images when there is low lighting. Additionally, using a delayed shutter release timer will allow you to snap shots without jiggling the camera.\n\nPeople watch a partial eclipse in Belfast, Northern Ireland, on March 20, 2015.\nCredits: Robin Cordiner\n\n#3 \u2013 Look Up, Down, All Around\nWhile the Sun is the most commanding element of a solar eclipse, remember to look around you. As the Moon slips in front of the Sun, the landscape will be bathed in eerie lighting and shadows. As light filters through the overlapping leaves of trees, it creates natural pinholes that project miniature eclipse replicas on the ground. Anywhere you can point your camera can yield exceptional imagery, so be sure to compose some wide-angle photos that can capture your eclipse experience.\nNASA photographer Bill Ingalls recommends focusing on the human experience of watching the eclipse. \u201cThe real pictures are going to be of the people around you pointing, gawking, and watching it,\u201d Ingalls noted. \u201cThose are going to be some great moments to capture to show the emotion of the whole thing.\u201d\n#4 \u2013 Practice\nBe sure you know the capabilities of your camera before eclipse day.",

Be sure to put your glasses back on before the total phase ends and the surface of the Sun becomes visible again. Your viewing location during the eclipse will determine how long you can see the eclipse in totality. In the U.S., viewers can expect to see 3.5 to 5.5 minutes of totality. After totality ends, a partial eclipse will continue for 60 to 80 minutes, ending when the edge of the Moon moves off of the disk of the Sun. For more information about the start of the partial eclipse, the start and duration of totality, and the percentage of the Sun eclipsed outside the path of totality, find your location on this eclipse map.

Visit the NASA Eclipse website for more information on safe eclipse viewing. When following proper safety guidelines, witnessing an eclipse is an unparalleled experience. Many \u201ceclipse chasers\u201d have been known to travel the world to see solar eclipses. Here's what to expect on April 8, 2024: The start time and visibility of the eclipse will depend on your location. You can use the interactive map below to find detailed eclipse information, including timing and coverage, by entering in your location. A list of some of the cities and start times along the path of totality is available on the NASA Science website. Explore when and where to view the eclipse with this interactive map from NASA. Enter your zip code to see what will be visible in your viewing location and when to watch. Credit: NASA's Scientific Visualization Studio The eclipse begins when the edge of the Moon first crosses in front of the disk of the Sun. This is called a partial eclipse and might look as if a bite has been taken out of the Sun. It is important to keep your eclipse glasses on during all parts of the partial solar eclipse. The visible part of the Sun is tens of thousands of times brighter than what you see during totality. You can also use a pinhole camera to view the eclipse. An approximately 115-mile-wide strip known as the path of totality is where the shadow of the Moon, or umbra, will fall on Earth. Inside this path, totality will be visible starting about 65 to 75 minutes after the eclipse begins. If you are in the path of totality, it is safe to take off your eclipse glasses and look at the total eclipse only during totality. Be sure to put your glasses back on before the total phase ends and the surface of the Sun becomes visible again. Your viewing location during the eclipse will determine how long you can see the eclipse in totality. In the U.S., viewers can expect to see 3.5 to 5.5 minutes of totality.",

How it works A pinhole camera works because the small hole you made with your pin, paper clip, or pencil acts like a tiny camera lens. Light from the Sun enters the pinhole (or the holes in an object like a colander), it gets focused, and then it is projected out of the other side of the hole. When the projected light reaches a surface, like the second piece of paper, you can see the image that passed through the pinhole.Learn more in the video above from artist Bob Miller's Light Walk at the Exploratorium in San Francisco, California.\n \n\nRelated TagsEarthEarth's MoonEclipseSolar EclipseAnnular EclipsePinhole CameraCamera ObscuraBuilding With PaperSunJump ToMaterials1.

Eclipse glasses are NOT the same as regular sunglasses; regular sunglasses are not safe for viewing the Sun. During a total solar eclipse, you must wear your eclipse glasses (or use other solar filters) to view the Sun directly during the partial eclipse phase. You can only take your glasses off during the short time when the Moon completely obscures the Sun \u2013 known as the period of totality. If you don\u2019t have eclipse glasses, you can use an indirect viewing method, such as a pinhole projector, which projects an image of the Sun onto a nearby surface.It is safe to look at the Moon with unprotected eyes or through a telescope during all types and during all stages of a lunar eclipse.Learn MoreA family wearing eclipse glasses watches the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017.",

During a lunar eclipse, the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, so the Moon passes through the Earth's shadow. This shadow blocks most of the Sun's light, but the small amount of light that is refracted, or bent, around the Earth's atmosphere can still reach the Moon and illuminate it, albeit dimly. This light is much less intense than the direct light from the Sun, so it is safe to look at the Moon with unprotected eyes or through a telescope during a lunar eclipse. In contrast, looking directly at the Sun during a solar eclipse can cause serious eye damage or blindness, which is why special protective equipment is necessary."

That light always beams onto Earth and Moon from the direction of the Sun, illuminating half of our planet in its orbit and reflecting off the surface of the Moon to create moonlight.Like Earth, the Moon has a day side and a night side, which change as the Moon rotates. The Sun always illuminates half of the Moon while the other half remains dark, but how much we are able to see of that illuminated half changes as the Moon travels through its orbit.This graphic shows the position of the Moon and the Sun during each of the Moon\u2019s phases and the Moon as it appears from Earth during each phase. Not to scale.NASA/JPL-CaltechLet\u2019s take a look at the individual phases, and how the movements of the Moon and Sun appear to us as we watch from the Northern Hemisphere on Earth:New MoonThis is the invisible phase of the Moon, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing the Sun and the night side facing Earth. In this phase, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun and rises and sets with the Sun. Not only is the illuminated side facing away from the Earth, it\u2019s also up during the day! Remember, in this phase, the Moon doesn\u2019t usually pass directly between Earth and the Sun, due to the inclination of the Moon\u2019s orbit. It only passes near the Sun from our perspective on Earth.Waxing CrescentThis silver sliver of a Moon occurs when the illuminated half of the Moon faces mostly away from Earth, with only a tiny portion visible to us from our planet. It grows daily as the Moon\u2019s orbit carries the Moon\u2019s dayside farther into view. Every day, the Moon rises a little bit later.First QuarterThe Moon is now a quarter of the way through its monthly journey and you see half of its illuminated side. People may casually call this a half moon, but remember, that\u2019s not really what you\u2019re witnessing in the sky. You\u2019re seeing just a slice of the entire Moon \u2015 half of the illuminated half.",

Remember to also use special filters over the lenses of cameras, telescopes, or binoculars when looking at the Sun. The only time during a solar eclipse when it\u2019s safe to look at the Sun without eclipse glasses is during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun\u2019s bright face. Ask an adult for help looking at the Sun.\n\nTotal solar eclipses happen somewhere around the world about once a year. But because the Moon casts a fairly small shadow, these eclipses can only be seen from a small area on Earth each time.\nOther things can also pass between us and the Sun and block some of its light. When this happens, it is called a transit. Different things like planets, comets, spacecraft, and even birds can transit the Sun.\n\nHow to Play\nThe goal of this game is to snap photos of eclipses and objects that transit the Sun. Here\u2019s how to play on your desktop:\n\nUse your cursor to center on objects passing in front of the Sun.\nPress the spacebar to take a picture.\nTo take a close-up picture you can zoom in and out using your laptop trackpad or scroll wheel on your mouse, or by pressing the W and S buttons on your keyboard.\nTo change the camera filter and get a different view of the Sun, press the A and D keys.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nSince the Sun is very bright, transiting objects look like dark shapes. During the game, you might notice some objects are bigger than others. That\u2019s because the objects are different sizes and different distances from you. Objects that are far away, like Mercury, look smaller \u2014 even though Mercury is an entire planet that\u2019s even larger than the Moon. Objects that are closer to Earth \u2013 or even in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, like a plane \u2013 look bigger. Here are some examples from the real world:\n\nMercury can be seen crossing the face of the Sun at the bottom of this picture.

Be sure to follow these safety guidelines when viewing a solar eclipse.Quick FactsThe next total solar eclipse visible in the contiguous United States will be on Aug. 23, 2044.Lunar eclipses occur during the full moon phase, and solar eclipses occur during the new moon phase.We can't normally see the corona \u2013\u2014the Sun's outer atmosphere \u2014 because Sun's surface below it is so much brighter. But during a total solar eclipse, the corona emerges, offering unique opportunities to study it.An eclipse season is one of only two periods during each year when the Sun, the Moon and Earth are aligned, allowing eclipses to occur. Each season lasts about 35 days and repeats just short of six months later!Featured StoryThe April 8 Total Solar Eclipse: Through the Eyes of NASAOn April 8, 2024, the Moon\u2019s shadow swept across North America, treating millions to a breathtaking view of a total\u2026Read the StorySafetyCitizen ScienceEclipse TypesScienceHistoryEye Safety During an EclipseObserving our star, the Sun, can be safe and inspirational.Except for a specific and brief period of time during a total solar eclipse, you must never look directly at the Sun without proper eye protection, such as safe solar viewing glasses (eclipse glasses). Eclipse glasses are NOT the same as regular sunglasses; regular sunglasses are not safe for viewing the Sun. During a total solar eclipse, you must wear your eclipse glasses (or use other solar filters) to view the Sun directly during the partial eclipse phase. You can only take your glasses off during the short time when the Moon completely obscures the Sun \u2013 known as the period of totality. If you don\u2019t have eclipse glasses, you can use an indirect viewing method, such as a pinhole projector, which projects an image of the Sun onto a nearby surface.It is safe to look at the Moon with unprotected eyes or through a telescope during all types and during all stages of a lunar eclipse.Learn MoreA family wearing eclipse glasses watches the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017.",
