Wales 's most celebrated medieval poet , Dafydd ap Gwilym ( fl. 1320 -- 1370 ) , composed poetry on themes including nature , religion and especially love . He is widely regarded as one of the greatest European poets of his age . Until the late 19th century the majority of Welsh literature was in Welsh and much of the prose was religious in character . Daniel Owen is credited as the first Welsh - language novelist , publishing Rhys Lewis in 1885 . The best - known of the Anglo - Welsh poets are both Thomases . Dylan Thomas became famous on both sides of the Atlantic in the mid-20th century . He is remembered for his poetry -- his `` Do not go gentle into that good night ; Rage , rage against the dying of the light '' is one of the most quoted couplets of English language verse -- and for his `` play for voices '' , Under Milk Wood . The influential Church in Wales `` poet - priest '' and Welsh nationalist R.S. Thomas was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1996 .
