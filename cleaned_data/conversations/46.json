'' The survival of the Empire in the East assured an active role of the Emperor in the affairs of the Church . The Byzantine state inherited from pagan times the administrative , and financial routine of administering religious affairs , and this routine was applied to the Christian Church . Following the pattern set by Eusebius of Caesarea , the Byzantines viewed the Emperor as a representative or messenger of Christ , responsible particularly for the propagation of Christianity among pagans , and for the `` externals '' of the religion , such as administration and finances . As Cyril Mango points out , the Byzantine political thinking can be summarised in the motto `` One God , one empire , one religion '' .",

The victorious legions , who , in distant wars , acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries , first oppressed the freedom of the republic , and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple . The emperors , anxious for their personal safety and the public peace , were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy ; the vigour of the military government was relaxed , and finally dissolved , by the partial institutions of Constantine ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians . --",

The empire had been a major economic, cultural, and military force in Europe for much of its history. However, various factors contributed to its decline and eventual fall, including military pressure from invading forces, political instability, and economic challenges. It is important to note that this is a complex historical topic with many contributing elements, so a comprehensive explanation would require a more detailed study of the relevant historical context."

Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC , though it did not expand outside of the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC . Civil war engulfed the Roman state in the mid 1st century BC , first between Julius Caesar and Pompey , and finally between Octavian and Mark Antony . Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian imperator ( `` commander '' ) thus beginning the Principate , the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD ; they later awarded him the name Augustus , `` the venerated '' . The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs : the Julio - Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors -- Tiberius , Caligula , Claudius , and Nero -- before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife - torn Year of Four Emperors , from which Vespasian emerged as victor . Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty , to be followed by the Nerva -- Antonine dynasty which produced the `` Five Good Emperors '' : Nerva , Trajan , Hadrian , Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius . In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius , a contemporary observer , the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 AD marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron '' -- a famous comment which has led some historians , notably Edward Gibbon , to take Commodus ' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire .",

In 395 , Theodosius I bequeathed the imperial office jointly to his sons : Arcadius in the East and Honorius in the West , once again dividing Imperial administration . In the 5th century the Eastern part of the empire was largely spared the difficulties faced by the West -- due in part to a more established urban culture and greater financial resources , which allowed it to placate invaders with tribute and pay foreign mercenaries . This success allowed Theodosius II to focus on the codification of Roman law and further fortification of the walls of Constantinople , which left the city impervious to most attacks until 1204 . Large portions of the Theodosian Walls are preserved to the present day .",
