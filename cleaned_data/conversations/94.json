But when it comes to enterprise applications, avoid registries that you don't know or don't trust to protect your cluster from malicious images. Keep your images in a private registry, like the one provided in IBM Cloud Container Registry and make sure to control access to the registry and the image content that can be pushed.\n\nWhy is it important to check images against vulnerabilities?\n: Research shows that most malicious attacks leverage known software vulnerabilities and weak system configurations.",

Vulnerability Advisor checks the security status of container images that are provided by IBM, third parties, or added to your organization's registry namespace.\n\nVulnerability Advisor provides security management for [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-startedgetting-started). Vulnerability Advisor generates a security status report that includes suggested fixes and best practices. Vulnerability Advisor is available in two versions: version 3 and version 4. Version 4 uses new architecture and a different scanning engine.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023. For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor. For more information, see [Getting started with Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n\nUsing Portieris to block the deployment of images with issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor is deprecated.\n\n\n\n About Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor provides functions to help you to secure your images.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023.",

How Container Registry interacts with your images\n\nA Docker image is the basis for every container that you create. An image is created from a\n\nDockerfile, which is a file that contains instructions to build the image. A Dockerfile might reference build artifacts in its instructions that are stored separately, such as an app, the configuration of the app, and its dependencies. Images are typically stored in a registry that can either be accessible by the public (public registry) or set up with limited access for a small group of users (private registry). By using Container Registry, only users with access to your IBM Cloud account can access your images.\n\nWhen you push images to Container Registry, you benefit from the built-in Vulnerability Advisor features that scan for potential security issues and vulnerabilities. Vulnerability Advisor checks for vulnerable packages in specific Docker base images, and known vulnerabilities in app configuration settings. When vulnerabilities are found, information about the vulnerability is provided. You can use this information to resolve security issues so that containers are not deployed from vulnerable images.\n\nReview the following table to find an overview of benefits of using Container Registry.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Cross Region provides higher durability and availability than using a single region at the cost of slightly higher latency. Regional service reverses those tradeoffs, and distributes objects across multiple availability zones within a single region. If a given region or availability zone is unavailable, the object store continues to function without impediment. Single Data Center distributes objects across multiple machines within the same physical location.\n\nUsers of Object Storage refer to their binary data, such as files, images, media, archives, or even entire databases as objects. Objects are stored in a bucket, the container for their unstructured data. Buckets contain both inherent and user-defined metadata. Finally, objects are defined by a globally unique combination of the bucket name and the object key, or name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Security \n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Crypto Services \n\n[Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) is a dedicated key management service and hardware security module (HSM) based on IBM Cloud.",
