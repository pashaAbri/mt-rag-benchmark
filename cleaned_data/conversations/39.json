You may ask a lawyer for advice before you \r\n go to court; however, you may not have a lawyer represent you in court. The \r\n rules are fairly simple and the hearing is informal. You may even ask for\r\n mediation\r\n the day of your trial.\n\nConsider Mediation\n\r\n An alternative to formal litigation in the court \r\n is the use of a mediator to resolve Small Claims disputes. All parties \r\n must mutually agree to mediation, and the formal rules of court do not apply to \r\n the mediation process. Parties may contact the Small Claim's mediation and\r\n advisory services to make arrangements for mediation before the court hears their case.\r\n Alternatively, the court will give parties an opportunity to meet with a mediator at\r\n the time of trial.\n\nInstead of a judge, you decide the outcome of your \r\n case\r\n \nYou can discuss many issues that may not be \r\n admitted in court \n\n\r\n The party filing the claim is the plaintiff. \r\n The person being sued is the defendant.\n\r\n If you are the defendant and are filing a Claim of \r\n Defendant, you will remain the defendant and the plaintiff will remain the \r\n plaintiff.\n\r\n The Small Claims court clerks can answer many \r\n kinds of questions and provide the forms you need; however, they are prohibited \r\n by law from giving legal advice. The Small Claims Mediation and Advisory Services provides legal \r\n advice free of charge to both the plaintiff and the defendant.\n\r\n If you choose Small Claims court to resolve a \r\n dispute and you are the plaintiff, you give up the right to have another court \r\n review the Small Claims judge's decision. In other words, the plaintiff has no \r\n right of appeal. So if you should lose, that is probably the end of the case. \r\n However, the person or entity you sue (defendant) may appeal the judge's ruling. \r\n When such an appeal is filed, the entire case will be heard again.\r\n \n\nLocation and Telephone Number\n\r\n The \r\n Carol Miller Justice Center is located at 301 \r\n Bicentennial Circle.

Small Claims cases are for damages of $10,000 or less. Small Claims is affordable and fast, with simple and informal rules. Attorneys are not allowed.\n\nWhat Is Small Claims Court?\nSmall claims court is a special court where disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively. The rules are simple and informal. The person who sues is the plaintiff. The person who is sued is the defendant. In small claims court, you may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to court, but you cannot have a lawyer in court.\nYour claim cannot be for more than $10,000.00. If you have a claim for more than this amount, you may file a limited civil case, or you may sue in the small claims court and give up your right to the amount over $10,000.00. You cannot, however, file more than two cases in small claims court for more than $2,500.00 each during a calendar year.\nWho Can File a Claim?\nYou must be at least 18 years old to file a claim. If you are not yet 18, you may ask the court to appoint a guardian ad litem. This is a person who will act for you in the case. The guardian ad litem is usually a parent, relative, or an adult friend. A person who sues in small claims court must first make a demand, if possible. This means that you have asked the defendant to pay, and the defendant has refused. If your claim is for possession of property, you must ask the defendant to give you the property.\nUnless you fall within two technical exceptions, you must be the original owner of the claim. This means that if the claim is assigned, the buyer cannot sue in the small claims court. You must also appear at the small claims hearing yourself unless you filed the claim for a corporation or other entity that is not a natural person.",

Small Claims cases are for damages of $10,000 or less. Small Claims is affordable and fast, with simple and informal rules. Attorneys are not allowed.\n\nWhat Is Small Claims Court?\nSmall claims court is a special court where disputes are resolved quickly and inexpensively. The rules are simple and informal. The person who sues is the plaintiff. The person who is sued is the defendant. In small claims court, you may ask a lawyer for advice before you go to court, but you cannot have a lawyer in court.\nYour claim cannot be for more than $10,000.00. If you have a claim for more than this amount, you may file a limited civil case, or you may sue in the small claims court and give up your right to the amount over $10,000.00. You cannot, however, file more than two cases in small claims court for more than $2,500.00 each during a calendar year.\nWho Can File a Claim?\nYou must be at least 18 years old to file a claim. If you are not yet 18, you may ask the court to appoint a guardian ad litem. This is a person who will act for you in the case. The guardian ad litem is usually a parent, relative, or an adult friend. A person who sues in small claims court must first make a demand, if possible. This means that you have asked the defendant to pay, and the defendant has refused. If your claim is for possession of property, you must ask the defendant to give you the property.\nUnless you fall within two technical exceptions, you must be the original owner of the claim. This means that if the claim is assigned, the buyer cannot sue in the small claims court. You must also appear at the small claims hearing yourself unless you filed the claim for a corporation or other entity that is not a natural person.",

          "text": "The Superior Court of California - County of Ventura - FAQs\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0When is Small Claims mediation appropriate?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0You can mediate your case before or after a small claims case has been filed. If you mediate before filing a case \r\n and an agreement is reached at the mediation, there will be no need to file a small claims case. If a case has already been filed, \r\n the agreement reached at the mediation can be entered into the court record without having to appear in court. You may also have \r\n an opportunity to mediate your case on the day of the hearing at the courthouse.\n\r\n Mediation may be particularly useful when parties have a relationship they want to preserve. So when family members, neighbors, \r\n or business partners have a dispute, mediation may be the most effective process to use. However, mediation may be beneficial in \r\n almost any kind of dispute between people. Mediation is effective even when emotions are getting in the way of resolution. An \r\n effective mediator can help the parties communicate with each other in a respectful and constructive manner.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0When may Small Claims mediation be inappropriate?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0Mediation may not be appropriate if one of the parties is unwilling to cooperate or communicate. Mediation also \r\n may not be effective if one of the parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, mediation may not be \r\n a good choice if the parties have a history of abuse or victimization. Mediation is not appropriate in cases in which a crime is involved.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0What is the role of the Small Claims mediator?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0The mediator is an impartial neutral intermediary whose role is to facilitate a discussion of the issues and \r\n perspectives between the parties in an effort to help them reach an agreement. The mediator does not impose a settlement, \r\n but will assist the parties in exploring settlement options. Generally, the mediator does not communicate with the court except \r\n to file the parties\u00e2\u0080\u0099 settlement agreement.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0Is Small Claims mediation confidential?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0All communication, negotiations, or settlement discussions in the court of a mediation or mediation consultation \r\n are confidential. This means that whatever is said in the mediation meeting, even if no settlement is reached, may not be used \r\n in any later court proceeding.",

This means that whatever is said in the mediation meeting, even if no settlement is reached, may not be used \r\n in any later court proceeding.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0Is Small Claims mediation required by the court?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0Mediation is a \"voluntary\" process. Any party may end a mediation at any time without adverse consequences. \r\n The mediator is not empowered to hold you in a mediation against your wishes. That said, there is so much that is offered by mediation, \r\n and so little to lose, that you are encouraged to participate fully.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0How long does a Small Claims mediation last and how do I prepare?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0Usually, mediation of a small claims dispute lasts around 30 minutes to an hour if held at the court. \r\n You need to be prepared to discuss all relevant issues in your case. You need to be prepared to state your position and \r\n to listen carefully to the other side. You will be required to exchange evidence with the other side. This will be a \r\n requirement by the court even if you do not mediate in order to shorten trial time.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0What if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settle our dispute at the Small claims mediation?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0If you and the other party are unable to reach a full agreement at the mediation, your case will still be \r\n decided by the Judge, Commissioner or Temporary Judge assigned to your small claims case usually on the same day your hearing \r\n was originally scheduled. If you mediate before filing a small claims case, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reach a full agreement, you can still \r\n file a small claims case with the court.\n\r\n However, your claim may be time sensitive, so you may want to check with your attorney or with the Small Claims Advisor to \r\n determine when you have to file your case. You can visit the Small Claims Advisor in person or call (805) 654-5054.\n\nFor more information please visit our Small Claims page.",
