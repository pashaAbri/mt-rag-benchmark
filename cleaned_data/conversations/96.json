Formal political union occurred on 3 October 1990 , preceded by the GDR declaring its accession to the Federal Republic through Article 23 of West Germany 's Basic Law ( meaning that constitutionally , East Germany was subsumed into West Germany ) ; but affected in strict legality through the subsequent Unification Treaty of 30 August 1990 , which was voted into their constitutions by both the West German Bundestag and the East German Volkskammer on 20 September 1990 . These votes simultaneously extinguished the GDR and affected fundamental amendments to the West German Basic Law ( including the repeal of the very Article 23 under which the GDR had recently declared its post-dated accession ) . On 2 December 1990 , all - German elections were held for the first time since 1933 . The `` new '' country stayed the same as the West German legal system and institutions were extended to the east . The unified nation kept the name Bundesrepublik Deutschland ( though the simple ' Deutschland ' would become increasingly common ) and retained the West German `` Deutsche Mark '' for currency as well . Berlin would formally become the capital of the united Germany , but the political institutions remained at Bonn for the time being . Only after a heated 1991 debate did the Bundestag conclude on moving itself and most of the government to Berlin as well , a process that took until 1999 to complete , when the Bundestag held its first session at the reconstructed Reichstag building . Many government departments still maintain sizable presences in Bonn as of 2008 .",

He was shot and bled to death , in full view of the Western media , on 17 August 1962 . Fechter 's death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of East Berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places , and provide medical care for possible `` would - be escapers '' . The last person to be shot and killed while trying to cross the border was Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989 , while the final person to die in an escape attempt was Winfried Freudenberg who was killed when his homemade natural gas - filled balloon crashed on 8 March 1989 .",

Before the Wall was built, 3.5 million East Germans had already defected from the GDR, many by crossing the border between East and West Berlin. However, after the Wall was erected in 1961, it became much more difficult to escape. Despite this, over 100,000 people attempted to escape and over 5,000 people succeeded in escaping over the Wall between 1961 and 1989. The methods used to escape included tunneling under the Wall, climbing over it, or using false papers to cross through checkpoints. However, these attempts often came with significant risks, and an estimated 136 to over 200 people died in and around Berlin while trying to cross the Wall."

Although Chancellor for only just over four years , Brandt was one of the most popular politicians in the whole period . Brandt was a gifted speaker and the growth of the Social Democrats from there on was in no small part due to his personality . Brandt began a policy of rapprochement with West Germany 's eastern neighbors known as Ostpolitik , a policy opposed by the CDU . The issue of improving relations with Poland , Czechoslovakia , and East Germany made for an increasingly aggressive tone in public debates but it was a huge step forward when Willy Brandt and the Foreign Minister , Walther Scheel ( FDP ) negotiated agreements with all three countries ( Moscow Agreement , August 1970 , Warsaw Agreement , December 1970 , Four - Power Agreement over the status of West Berlin in 1971 and an agreement on relations between West and East Germany , signed in December 1972 ) . These agreements were the basis for a rapid improvement in the relations between east and west and led , in the long term , to the dismantlement of the Warsaw Treaty and the Soviet Union 's control over East - Central Europe . During a visit to Warsaw on 7 December 1970 , Brandt made the Warschauer Kniefall by kneeling before a monument to those killed in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a gesture of humility and penance that no German Chancellor had made until that time . Chancellor Brandt was forced to resign in May 1974 , after G\u00fcnter Guillaume , a senior member of his staff , was uncovered as a spy for the East German intelligence service , the Stasi . Brandt 's contributions to world peace led to his winning the Nobel Peace Prize for 1971 . U.S.",

          "text": "Berlin Wall\nWith the closing of the East - West sector boundary in Berlin , the vast majority of East Germans could no longer travel or emigrate to West Germany . Berlin soon went from being the easiest place to make an unauthorized crossing between East and West Germany to being the most difficult . Many families were split , while East Berliners employed in the West were cut off from their jobs . West Berlin became an isolated exclave in a hostile land . West Berliners demonstrated against the Wall , led by their Mayor ( Oberb\u00fcrgermeister ) Willy Brandt , who strongly criticized the United States for failing to respond . Allied intelligence agencies had hypothesized about a wall to stop the flood of refugees , but the main candidate for its location was around the perimeter of the city . In 1961 , Secretary of State Dean Rusk proclaimed , `` The Wall certainly ought not to be a permanent feature of the European landscape . I see no reason why the Soviet Union should think it is -- it is to their advantage in any way to leave there that monument to communist failure . ''",

Brandt received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 for his efforts in strengthening cooperation between East and West."
