  "gold_answer": "The primary reason is that joy must always be tempered . This is based on two accounts in the Talmud of rabbis who , upon seeing that their son 's wedding celebration was getting out of hand , broke a vessel -- in the second case a glass -- to calm things down . Another explanation is that it is a reminder that despite the joy , Jews still mourn the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem .",

It was introduced by Georgia Representative Bob Barr and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma. The Act was intended by Congress to reflect and honor a collective moral judgment and to express moral disapproval of homosexuality. It defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife, and a spouse as a husband or wife of the opposite sex. The bill moved quickly through Congress and was passed by an overwhelming majority in both houses of the Republican-controlled Congress. On July 12, 1996, 342 members of the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass DOMA, and on September 10, 1996, 84 Senators voted in favor of DOMA. The Act was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on September 21, 1996. However, Section 3 of DOMA, which defined marriage and spouse for federal purposes, was struck down by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, in the case of United States v. Windsor. By defining `` spouse '' and its related terms to signify a heterosexual couple in a recognized marriage , Section 3 codified non-recognition of same - sex marriages for all federal purposes , including insurance benefits for government employees , social security survivors ' benefits , immigration , bankruptcy , and the filing of joint tax returns , as well as excluding same - sex spouses from the scope of laws protecting families of federal officers ( 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 115 ) , laws evaluating financial aid eligibility , and federal ethics laws applicable to opposite - sex spouses .\n|user|: How is marriage defined?\n|assistant|: According to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as it stood before Section 3 was struck down in 2013, marriage was defined as the legal union of a man and a woman as husband and wife for federal purposes. This definition was used to deny federal recognition to same-sex marriages, which meant that same-sex married couples were not eligible for federal marriage benefits. However, it is important to note that this definition has been deemed unconstitutional by the Supreme Court. As of now, marriage is legally recognized as a union between two consenting adults, regardless of their sex or gender identity, in many jurisdictions around the world. Same - sex marriage has been legal in the United States since 26 June 2015 .\n|user|: How are weddings celebrated?\n|assistant|: The way weddings are celebrated can vary greatly depending on cultural, religious, and personal preferences. Generally, a wedding is a ceremony where two people are united in marriage. It often involves an exchange of vows and the exchange of symbolic items such as rings. Weddings can be civil or religious and can take place in a variety of locations, from a courthouse or a church to a beach or a garden. They can be small, intimate affairs with only close family and friends in attendance, or they can be large, elaborate events with hundreds of guests. There are also many traditions and customs associated with weddings, such as the bride wearing a white dress, the groom wearing a tuxedo, and the throwing of the bouquet. However, these traditions can also vary and are often adapted to suit the couple's personal style and beliefs. Ultimately, the most important aspect of a wedding is the commitment being made between the two people getting married. In traditional Christian ceremonies , the bride 's father will `` give away '' ( hand off ) the bride to the groom . Secular weddings are also common , often presided over by a judge , Justice of the Peace , or other municipal official .\n|user|: What is the meaning of the glass being broken at a Jewish wedding?"

Until Section 3 of the Act was struck down in 2013 ( United States v. Windsor ) , DOMA , in conjunction with other statutes , had barred same - sex married couples from being recognized as `` spouses '' for purposes of federal laws , effectively barring them from receiving federal marriage benefits . DOMA 's passage did not prevent individual states from recognizing same - sex marriage , but it imposed constraints on the benefits received by all legally married same - sex couples .",
