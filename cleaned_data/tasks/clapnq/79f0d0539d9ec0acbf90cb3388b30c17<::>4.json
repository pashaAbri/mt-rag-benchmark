  "gold_answer": " Archaeological discoveries suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia but scholars assumed that the original land of the Celts was west of the Rhine , more precisely in Gaul , because it was where Greek and Roman ancient sources , namely Caesar , located the Celts . This view was challenged by the 19th - century historian Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville who placed the land of origin of the Celts east of the Rhine.  Jubainville based his arguments on a phrase of Herodotus ' that placed the Celts at the source of the Danube , and argued that Herodotus had meant to place the Celtic homeland in southern Germany . The finding of the prehistoric cemetery of Hallstat in 1846 by Johan Ramsauer and the finding of the archaeological site of La T\u00e8ne by Hansli Kopp in 1857 drew attention to this area. Archaeologists have also discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany . As the territory held by the Celts contained tin , lead , iron , silver and gold , they were metalworkers that created weapons and jewellery for international trade , particularly with the Romans .",
