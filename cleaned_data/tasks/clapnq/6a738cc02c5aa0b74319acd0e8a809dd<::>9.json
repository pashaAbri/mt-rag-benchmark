Additionally , in most countries where it is legal and compensated , the law places a cap on the compensation and that cap tends to be in the vicinity of $1000 -- $2000 . In the US , no law caps the compensation , but the American Society for Reproductive Medicine ( ASRM ) requires member clinics to abide by ASRM standards , which provide that `` sums of $5,000 or more require justification and sums above $10,000 are not appropriate . '' The `` justification '' for payments over $5000 may include previous successful donations , unusually good family health history , or membership in minority ethnicities for which it is more difficult to find donors .",

The European Union limits any financial compensation for donors to at most $1500 . In some countries , most notably Spain and Cyprus , this has limited donors to the poorest segments of society . In the United States , donors are paid regardless of how many eggs she produces . A donor 's compensation may increase for each additional time she provides eggs , especially if the donor 's eggs have a history of reliably resulting in the recipient becoming pregnant . In the United States , egg - broker agencies are known for advertising to college students who are more likely to be in financial situations that motivate them to participate for the financial compensation . It is not unusual for one student to donate many times . Often , this is done without consideration of potential long - term health consequences . Such a student is arguably not making the decision to donate her eggs autonomously due to her unfavorable financial situation .",
