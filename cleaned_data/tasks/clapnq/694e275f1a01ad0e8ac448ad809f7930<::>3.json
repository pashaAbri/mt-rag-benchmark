    "text": "Soccer, also known as football in many parts of the world, is a sport where two teams of 11 players each try to score goals by kicking a ball into the opposing team's net between two goalposts. The goal or line being defended by the opposing team and the players only can use their body to move the ball. Nevertheless, in the American football, also know gridiron , is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , which is the team controlling the oval - shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball , while the defense , which is the team without control of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and aims to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs , or plays , and otherwise they turn over the football to the defense ; if the offense succeeds in advancing ten yards or more , they are given a new set of four downs . Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins .",

    "original_text": "Soccer, also known as football in many parts of the world, is a sport where two teams of 11 players each try to score goals by kicking a ball into the opposing team's net. The game is played with the feet, hands are not allowed except by the goalkeepers. On the other hand, American Football is a sport that involves two teams of eleven players each trying to advance an oval-shaped ball towards the opposing team's end zone while preventing the other team from doing the same. The game allows for the use of hands, and players can throw, catch, and run with the ball. Another key difference is that soccer is played in two 45-minute halves with a 15-minute break in between, while American Football is divided into four 15-minute quarters with a 12-minute break at halftime.\nIn summary, the main differences between soccer and American football are the way the ball is moved (with feet in soccer and hands in American football), the objective of the game (scoring goals in soccer and touchdowns in American football), and the duration of the game."
