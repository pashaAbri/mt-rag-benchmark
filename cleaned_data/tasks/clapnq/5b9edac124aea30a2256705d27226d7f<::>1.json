  "gold_answer": "Yes, based on the provided document, Shakespeare's plays were popular during his lifetime.  Hamlet appears to have been his fourth most popular play at that time, surpassed only by Henry IV Part 1 , Richard III and Pericles. Romeo and Juliet is also known to have been extremely popular then, so much so that it was performed outside of England as well, in N\u00f6rdlingen in 1604.",

      "text": "Hamlet\nShakespeare almost certainly wrote the role of Hamlet for Richard Burbage . He was the chief tragedian of the Lord Chamberlain 's Men , with a capacious memory for lines and a wide emotional range . Judging by the number of reprints , Hamlet appears to have been Shakespeare 's fourth most popular play during his lifetime -- only Henry IV Part 1 , Richard III and Pericles eclipsed it . Shakespeare provides no clear indication of when his play is set ; however , as Elizabethan actors performed at the Globe in contemporary dress on minimal sets , this would not have affected the staging .",

      "text": "Shakespeare's reputation\nIn the Romantic age , Shakespeare became extremely popular in Russia . Vissarion Belinsky wrote he had been `` enslaved by the drama of Shakespeare '' . Russia 's national poet , Alexander Pushkin , was heavily influenced by Hamlet and the history plays , and his novel Boris Godunov showed strong Shakespearean influences . Later on , in the 19th century , the novelist Ivan Turgenev often wrote essays on Shakespeare with the best known being `` Hamlet and Don Quixote '' . Fyodor Dostoevsky was greatly influenced by Macbeth with the his novel Crime and Punishment showing Shakespearean influence in his treatment of the theme of guilt . From the 1840s onward , Shakespeare was regularly staged in Russia , and the black American actor Ira Aldridge who had been barred from the stage in the United States on the account of his skin color became the leading Shakespearean actor in Russia in the 1850s , being decorated by the Emperor Alexander II for his work in portraying Shakespearean characters .",

      "text": "Romeo and Juliet\nRomeo and Juliet ranks with Hamlet as one of Shakespeare 's most performed plays . Its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories . Even in Shakespeare 's lifetime , it was extremely popular . Scholar Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare 's plays , in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London 's dominant playwright . The date of the first performance is unknown . The First Quarto , printed in 1597 , says that `` it hath been often ( and with great applause ) plaid publiquely '' , setting the first performance before that date . The Lord Chamberlain 's Men were certainly the first to perform it . Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare , the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors , Will Kemp , instead of Peter , in a line in Act Five . Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo , being the company 's actor , and Master Robert Goffe ( a boy ) the first Juliet . The premiere is likely to have been at `` The Theatre '' , with other early productions at `` The Curtain '' . Romeo and Juliet is one of the first Shakespearean plays to have been performed outside England : a shortened and simplified version was performed in N\u00f6rdlingen in 1604 .",

It was probably one of Shakespeare 's most popular works during his lifetime , and still ranks among his most performed , topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford - upon - Avon since 1879 . It has inspired many other writers -- from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch -- and has been described as `` the world 's most filmed story after Cinderella '' .",
