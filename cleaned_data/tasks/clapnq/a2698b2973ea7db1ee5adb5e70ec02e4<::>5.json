That legislation was concerned primarily first - generation pollutants in the air , surface water , groundwater , and solid waste disposal . Later solid waste contaminants from agriculture , industry , mining , municipalities , and others were put under control .EPA have spent more than than $8.7 million on environmental education annually to increase public knowledge and awareness about the current environmental issues and the consequences . They aim to promote the popularization of the necessary skills and knowledge for the public to make decisions and participate in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges . Virtually all of the executive branch 's departments have some area of environmental authority .The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) issued stormwater regulations for  cities , suburban communities and towns with over 10,000 population requiring them  to obtain discharge permits for their storm sewer systems , under the Clean Water Act . The permits require local governments to operate stormwater management programs , covering both construction of new buildings and facilities , and maintenance of their existing municipal drainage networks . Many municipalities have revised their local ordinances covering management of runoff . State government facilities , such as roads and highways , are also subject to the stormwater management regulations . Many local municipalities have placed ordinances for both commercial and residential stormwater management practices to be designed , implemented , and approved before an occupancy permit is released .New developments might be required to construct their own storm drain processing capacity for returning the runoff to the water table and bioswales may be required in sensitive ecological areas to protect the watershed ",

                  "model_text": "|user|: where does water go after it enters a storm drain\n|assistant|: The water that enters a storm drain like some of the heavier sediment and small objects may settle in a catchbasin , or sump , which lies immediately below the outlet , where water from the top of the catchbasin reservoir overflows into the sewer proper . Most drains have a single large exit at their point of discharge ( often covered by a grating ) into a canal , river , lake , reservoir , sea or ocean . Storm drains may discharge into man - made excavations known as recharge basins or retention ponds .\n|user|: What is a catchbasin and how they are designed?\n|assistant|: A catchbasin is a component in a storm drain system that serves as a first-line pretreatment for other treatment practices. It functions similarly to the trap in household wastewater plumbing by capturing large sediments and street litter from urban runoff before it enters the storm drainage pipes. It is designed with a single large exit at its point of discharge, often covered by a grating, and lies immediately below the outlet of the storm drain. Water from the top of the catchbasin reservoir overflows into the sewer proper, and most catchbasins are connected to a piping system that leads to a canal, river, lake, reservoir, sea, or ocean.  Unlike the plumbing trap , the catchbasin does not necessarily prevent sewer gases such as hydrogen sulfide and methane from escaping. Its performance at removing sediment and other pollutants depends on the design of the catchbasin ( for example , the size of the sump ) , and on routine maintenance to retain the storage available in the sump to capture sediment . Some  catch basins are also commonly designed with a sump area below the outlet pipe level which is a reservoir for water and debris to help prevent the pipe from clogging \n|user|: Does the basin really capture the litter  and debris from the water from the streets, roads, roofs?\n|assistant|: As I mentioned before the are commonly designed to capture large sediments and street litter from urban runoff before it enters the storm drainage pipes. However its  functionality is questionable , as these catch basins are most commonly not cleaned annually as is needed to make them perform as designed . The trapping of debris serves no purpose because once filled they operate as if no basins were present , but continue to allow a shallow area of water retention for the breeding of mosquito since it is cool , dark , and retains stagnant water for long periods of time . Combined with standard grates which have holes large enough for mosquitoes to enter and leave the basin , this is a major problem in mosquito control .  . Moreover , even if cleaned and maintained , the water reservoir remains filled , accommodating the breeding of mosquitoes .\n|user|: Could be the water that enters a storm drain recycled and be used in the house chores like cleaning, gardening , etc?\n|assistant|: As you probably know the water from urban runoff is very dirty. It tends to pick up gasoline , motor oil , heavy metals , trash and other pollutants from roadways and parking lots , as well as fertilizers and pesticides from lawns  and may become contaminated while running down the road or other impervious surface , before entering the drain and could not be used in house chores. However,  Many local governments conduct public awareness campaigns about this including sustainable urban drainage systems or low impact development or green infrastructure practices   into municipal plans , helping lest waste be dumped into the storm drain system . In the city of Cleveland , Ohio , for example , all new catch basins installed have inscriptions on them not to dump any waste , and usually include a fish imprint as well . \n|user|: And about on the level of the Federal government, do  they have guidelines or even a law to how to build more sustainable storm drain so the water could be recycled ?"

    "original_text": "At the federal level in the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has regulations and guidelines for managing stormwater, including the construction of stormwater systems. However, the primary focus of these regulations is to protect water quality and aquatic ecosystems by reducing the amount of pollutants that enter receiving waters through stormwater runoff.\nThe EPA's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit program controls stormwater discharges from certain industrial activities, construction sites, and municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). These permits require the implementation of best management practices (BMPs) to reduce pollutants in stormwater runoff.\nWhile the EPA encourages the use of green infrastructure practices to manage stormwater, there is no federal law mandating the recycling of stormwater for household uses like cleaning or gardening. However, some states and localities have their own regulations and incentives promoting the use of sustainable stormwater management practices, including stormwater harvesting and reuse.\nIt's worth noting that recycling stormwater for household uses requires additional treatment and filtration beyond what is typically provided by stormwater management practices, and may not be feasible or cost-effective in all cases. Nonetheless, innovative approaches to stormwater management that prioritize sustainability and resource recovery are gaining popularity and can provide multiple benefits, including improved water quality, reduced flood risk, and increased community resilience."
