      "text": "Vallabhbhai Patel\nHistorians believe that Patel 's speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists , who up to then had been skeptical of the proposed rebellion . Patel 's organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India . Patel was arrested on 9 August and was imprisoned with the entire Congress Working Committee from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar . Here he spun cloth , played bridge , read a large number of books , took long walks , and practised gardening . He also provided emotional support to his colleagues while awaiting news and developments from the outside . Patel was deeply pained at the news of the deaths of Mahadev Desai and Kasturba Gandhi later that year . But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing `` fullest peace '' for having done `` their duty '' . Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British had employed ruthless means of suppression , the Quit India movement was `` by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857 '' , as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill . More than 100,000 people were arrested and many were killed in violent struggles with the police . Strikes , protests , and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India . When Patel was released on 15 June 1945 , he realised that the British were preparing proposals to transfer power to India .",
