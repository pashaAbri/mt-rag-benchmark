One was the Cabinet Law , which required the Imperial Japanese Army ( IJA ) and Imperial Japanese Navy ( IJN ) to nominate servinet could be formed . This essentially gave the military veto power over the formation of any Cabinet in the ostensibly parliamentary country . Another factor was gekokuj\u014d , or institutionalized disobedience by junior officers . It was not uncommon for radical junior officers to press their goals , to the extent of assassinating their seniors . In 1936 , this phenomenon resulted in the February 26 Incident , in which junior officers attempted a coup d'\u00e9tat and killed leading members of the Japanese government . In the 1930s , the Great Depression wrecked Japan 's economy and gave radical elements within the Japanese military the chance to force the entire military into working towards the conquest of all of Asia . For example , in 1931 the Kwantung Army ( a Japanese military force stationed in Manchuria ) staged the Mukden Incident , which sparked the Invasion of Manchuria and its transformation into the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo .",
