        "text": "Grenade (song)\nLyrically , the song contains masochistic themes and tells the story of heartbreak caused by a failed relationship : `` Gave you all I had / And you tossed it in the trash '' . The chorus has Mars singing , `` I 'd catch a grenade for ya , '' and speaks of unrequited love when the subject girl of his affections `` wo n't do the same '' . Tim Byron , writer for The Vine , `` ' Grenade ' is about the feeling of withdrawal '' . The critic added , `` Mars knows she is bad for him , that 's she 's preventing him from thinking straight , that he ca n't actually have her the way he wants , but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her . '' As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul : `` ' Grenade ' represents the OTHER side of love -- where you 're in love with a woman and you know for a fact that she does n't love you the way you love HER .

In a behind - the - scenes video , Mars explained , `` The concept of the video is my struggle , to tell this girl I 'd do anything for her , so I 'm going as far as dragging a piano to get to her just so I can sing my heart out . '' Mars , sarcastically , replied to rumors related to the use of special effects : `` A lot of people think this is a camera trick , but that is a heavy piano . Luckily , I 've been doing about , you know , 800 to 967 push - ups every day , so it 's not a big deal , I can handle it . '' Regardless , this achievement , Mars was cautious : `` The actions in this video serve as a metaphor , and should not be taken literally . I am aware of the power of visual media , and I encourage everyone who watches this video to understand that it is an artistic interpretation of the song , and not something to imitate '' .",
