        "text": "American football\nAmerican football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of association football ( known in the U.S. as soccer ) and rugby football . The first match of American football was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , under rules based on the association football rules of the time . During the latter half of the 1870s , colleges playing association football switched to the Rugby Union code , which allowed carrying the ball . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the `` Father of American Football '' , established the snap , eleven - player teams , and the concept of downs ; later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone , and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved parallel and contemporary to the American game , and most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football .",

Early forms of rugby were often referred to as \"football,\" and the first intercollegiate football game in the United States, played between Princeton and Rutgers in 1869, was based on rugby principles. Over time, these principles evolved into the distinct sport of American football, characterized by features such as forward passing, down-and-distance rules, and protective gear."
