Retail supermarkets are expanding , with a market share of 4 % in 2008 . In 2012 , the government permitted 51 % FDI in multi-brand retail and 100 % FDI in single - brand retail . However , a lack of back - end warehouse infrastructure and state - level permits and red tape continue to limit growth of organised retail . Compliance with over thirty regulations such as `` signboard licences '' and `` anti-hoarding measures '' must be made before a store can open for business . There are taxes for moving goods from state to state , and even within states . According to The Wall Street Journal , the lack of infrastructure and efficient retail networks cause a third of India 's agriculture produce to be lost from spoilage .",
