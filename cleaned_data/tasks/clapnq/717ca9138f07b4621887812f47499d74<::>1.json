The cast members received different salaries in the second season , beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode . Before their salary negotiations for the third season , the cast decided to enter collective negotiations , despite Warner Bros . ' preference for individual deals . The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member , meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced . The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three , $85,000 in season four , $100,000 in season five , $125,000 in season six , $750,000 in seasons seven and eight , and $1 million in seasons nine and ten , making Aniston , Cox , and Kudrow the highest - paid TV actresses of all time . The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations . At the time , that financial benefit of a piece of the show 's lucrative back - end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show , like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby .",
