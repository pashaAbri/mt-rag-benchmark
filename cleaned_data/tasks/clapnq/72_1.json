  "gold_answer": "The water that enters a storm drain like some of the heavier sediment and small objects may settle in a catchbasin , or sump , which lies immediately below the outlet , where water from the top of the catchbasin reservoir overflows into the sewer proper . Most drains have a single large exit at their point of discharge ( often covered by a grating ) into a canal , river , lake , reservoir , sea or ocean . Storm drains may discharge into man - made excavations known as recharge basins or retention ponds .",

      "text": "Storm drain\nCatch basins are commonly designed with a sump area below the outlet pipe level which is a reservoir for water and debris to help prevent the pipe from clogging . Unless they are constructed with permeable bottoms to allow water to infiltrate into the underlying soil , this subterranean basin can become a perfect mosquito breeding area because it is cool , dark , and retains stagnant water for long periods of time . Combined with standard grates which have holes large enough for mosquitoes to enter and leave the basin , this is a major problem in mosquito control .",

To reduce stormwater from rooftops , flows from eaves troughs ( rain gutters and downspouts ) may be infiltrated into adjacent soil , rather than discharged into the storm sewer system . Storm water runoff from paved surfaces can be directed to unlined ditches ( sometimes called swales or bioswales ) before flowing into the storm sewers , again to allow the runoff to soak into the ground . Permeable paving materials can be used in building sidewalks , driveways and in some cases , parking lots , to infiltrate a portion of the stormwater volume .",
