      "text": "History of the Roman Empire\nThe history of the Roman Empire covers the history of Ancient Rome from the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC until the abdication of the last Western emperor in 476 AD . Rome had begun expanding shortly after the founding of the Republic in the 6th century BC , though it did not expand outside of the Italian Peninsula until the 3rd century BC . Civil war engulfed the Roman state in the mid 1st century BC , first between Julius Caesar and Pompey , and finally between Octavian and Mark Antony . Antony was defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . In 27 BC the Senate and People of Rome made Octavian imperator ( `` commander '' ) thus beginning the Principate , the first epoch of Roman imperial history usually dated from 27 BC to 284 AD ; they later awarded him the name Augustus , `` the venerated '' . The success of Augustus in establishing principles of dynastic succession was limited by his outliving a number of talented potential heirs : the Julio - Claudian dynasty lasted for four more emperors -- Tiberius , Caligula , Claudius , and Nero -- before it yielded in 69 AD to the strife - torn Year of Four Emperors , from which Vespasian emerged as victor . Vespasian became the founder of the brief Flavian dynasty , to be followed by the Nerva -- Antonine dynasty which produced the `` Five Good Emperors '' : Nerva , Trajan , Hadrian , Antoninus Pius and the philosophically inclined Marcus Aurelius . In the view of the Greek historian Dio Cassius , a contemporary observer , the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 AD marked the descent `` from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron '' -- a famous comment which has led some historians , notably Edward Gibbon , to take Commodus ' reign as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire .",

      "text": "Third Rome\nIn the 8th century , the Franks , with the support of the Catholic Church , had established an Empire that compromised most of Western Europe . As Charlemagne ( German : Karl der Gro\u00dfe ) inherited the Frankish realm , he expanded it to all of Central and Western Europe except the southern tip of Italy and Iberia , and proclaimed the Roman Empire ( calling it the Holy Roman Empire ) to have been reestablished , and was crowned as Roman Emperor by the Pope in Rome . During his reign , he launched an enormous project to resurrect Roman culture , copying the former Empire 's organisational , education and legal systems , art , and classical literature . This is today known as the Carolingian Renaissance , and its main instrument was the Catholic church , the only Roman institution that had survived the collapse , and preserved major elements of Greco - Roman thought , philosophy , science and administration . This , combined with the influence of the Eastern Roman Empire over eastern Europe and the spread of Orthodox Christendom , lead to the subsequent European renaissances ( i.e. the Ottoian , 12th century and in particular the Italian Renaissance from the 14th to 17th centuries ) , which transferred Roman culture to modern era Europe .",
