  "input": "The Snake River is the longest river in the country.",
  "gold_answer": "No. The Snake River is the thirteenth longest river in the United States. The longest river is the Mississippi River, the chief river of the second-largest drainage system on the North American continent, second only to the Hudson Bay drainage system. Using the longest stream as the source, Brower's Spring in Montana, the source of the Missouri River, would give it an incredible length of 3,710 miles, making it the fourth longest river in the world after the Nile, Amazon, and Yangtze. If we use the Largest Stream measurement, the Ohio River, and by extension the Allegheny River would be the source, and the Mississippi would begin in Pennsylvania.",

The stream is entirely within the United States ( although its drainage basin reaches into Canada ) , its source is in northern Minnesota and it flows generally south for 2,320 miles ( 3,730 km ) to the Mississippi River Delta in the Gulf of Mexico . With its many tributaries , the Mississippi 's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains . The Mississippi ranks as the fourth - longest and fifteenth - largest river in the world by discharge . The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota , Wisconsin , Iowa , Illinois , Missouri , Kentucky , Tennessee , Arkansas , Mississippi , and Louisiana .",

Its watershed is the 10th largest among North American rivers , and covers almost 108,000 square miles ( 280,000 km ) in portions of six U.S. states : Wyoming , Idaho , Nevada , Utah , Oregon , and Washington , with the largest portion in Idaho . Most of the Snake River watershed lies between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Columbia Plateau on the northwest . The largest tributary of the Columbia River , the Snake River watershed makes up about 41 % of the entire Columbia River Basin . Its average discharge at the mouth constitutes 31 % of the Columbia 's flow at that point . Above the confluence , the Snake is slightly longer than the Columbia -- 1,078 miles ( 1,735 km ) compared to 928 miles ( 1,493 km ) -- and its drainage basin is slightly larger -- 4 % bigger than the upstream Columbia River watershed .",

However , besides names given on maps , there are at least 2 other ways to measure the length of a river . The first is the Longest stream source ( most distant source from the sea ) and the second is the largest stream source ( by water volume ) . Using the longest stream , the source would be Brower 's Spring in Montana , the source of the Missouri River . This would give it a an incredible length of 3,710 miles , making it the fourth longest river in the world after the Nile , Amazon , and Yangtze .
