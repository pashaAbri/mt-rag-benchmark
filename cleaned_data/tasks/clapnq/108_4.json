  "gold_answer": "General Douglas MacArthur did not hold Emperor Hirohito responsible for war crimes because he believed that the continuation of the imperial institution was necessary for the stability and rehabilitation of Japan.  At a meeting with the General later in September aboard the Missouri, Emperor Hirohito offered to take blame for the war crimes, but his offer was rejected, and he was never tried. As the Allied seemed to leave intact the principle of the preservation of the Throne , the Declaration made no mention of the Emperor at all . Allied intentions on issues of utmost importance to the Japanese, including whether Hirohito was to be regarded as one of those who had misled the people of Japan '' or even a war criminal, or alternatively, whether the Emperor might become part of a peacefully inclined and responsible government '' were thus left unstated.",
