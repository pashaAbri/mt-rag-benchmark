  "gold_answer": "Hamnet is the name of William Shakespeare's only son. He was born in 1585 and died in 1596 at the age of 11. The death of Hamnet had a profound impact on Shakespeare, and some literary scholars believe that it may have influenced his work, particularly his play \"Hamlet,\" which was written around the same time. However, this connection is still a subject of debate, most scholars rejecting the idea that the play is in any way connected to Shakespeare's son.",

      "text": "Romeo and Juliet\nRomeo and Juliet ranks with Hamlet as one of Shakespeare 's most performed plays . Its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories . Even in Shakespeare 's lifetime , it was extremely popular . Scholar Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare 's plays , in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London 's dominant playwright . The date of the first performance is unknown . The First Quarto , printed in 1597 , says that `` it hath been often ( and with great applause ) plaid publiquely '' , setting the first performance before that date . The Lord Chamberlain 's Men were certainly the first to perform it . Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare , the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors , Will Kemp , instead of Peter , in a line in Act Five . Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo , being the company 's actor , and Master Robert Goffe ( a boy ) the first Juliet . The premiere is likely to have been at `` The Theatre '' , with other early productions at `` The Curtain '' . Romeo and Juliet is one of the first Shakespearean plays to have been performed outside England : a shortened and simplified version was performed in N\u00f6rdlingen in 1604 .",

Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend , and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time . However , Stephen Greenblatt has argued that the coincidence of the names and Shakespeare 's grief for the loss of his son may lie at the heart of the tragedy . He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler , the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named , was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that , in the loose orthography of the time , the names were virtually interchangeable .",
