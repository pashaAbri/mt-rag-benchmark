  "gold_answer": "Yes, the Hudson River is considered an important river in the United States. The 315-mile-long Hudson River flows through eastern New York, serving as a boundary between New Jersey and New York. The region has experienced economic revitalization, especially in green development. Notable projects such as the High Line and the Walkway Over the Hudson, along with waterfront parks and annual festivals, contribute to the area's appeal. The Hudson River valley runs primarily from north to south down the eastern edge of New York State, cutting through a series of rock types including Triassic sandstones and redbeds in the south, and much more ancient Precambrian gneiss in the north (and east).",

      "text": "Hudson River\nThe Hudson River is a 315 - mile ( 507 km ) river that flows from north to south primarily through eastern New York in the United States . The river originates in the Adirondack Mountains of Upstate New York , flows through the Hudson Valley , and eventually drains into the Atlantic Ocean , between New York City and Jersey City . The river serves as a political boundary between the states of New Jersey and New York , and further north between New York counties . The lower half of the river is a tidal estuary occupying the Hudson Fjord , an inlet which formed during the most recent period of North American glaciation , estimated at 26,000 to 13,300 years ago . Tidal waters influence the Hudson 's flow from as far north as Troy .",

In 2009 , the High Line was opened in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan . This linear park has views of the river throughout its length . Also in 2009 , the original Poughkeepsie railroad bridge , since abandoned , was converted into the Walkway Over the Hudson , a pedestrian park over the river . Emblematic of the increase in green development in the region , waterfront parks in cities like Kingston , Poughkeepsie , and Beacon were built , and several festivals are held annually .",
