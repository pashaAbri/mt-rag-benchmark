  "gold_answer": "The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from present - day Sino - Russian border in the north to Qinghai in the south. The walls built by the Ming dynasty measure 8,850 km. Faced with the threat of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks from the north, the Qi built up to 3,000 li about 1,600 kilometers. The Xuan - Da portion of the Great Wall totaled about 850 kilometers of wall, with some sections being doubled - up with two lines of wall, some tripled or even quadrupled. Chancellor Wanyan Xiang convinced the emperor to build an extensive systems of walls, which consisted of a 700 kilometers outer wall from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a 1,000 kilometers network of inner walls, north and northeast of Beijing. Together, they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications 1,400 kilometers in length.",

During the Ming , however , bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall , as were materials such as tiles , lime , and stone . The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone , so construction quickened . Additionally , bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth . Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick , but is more difficult to use . Consequently , stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation , inner and outer brims , and gateways of the wall . Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall , with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm ( 12 in ) tall , and about 23 cm ( 9.1 in ) wide . From the parapets , guards could survey the surrounding land . Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall , including the ability to call reinforcements and warn garrisons of enemy movements , was of high importance . Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility . Wooden gates could be used as a trap against those going through . Barracks , stables , and armories were built near the wall 's inner surface .",

Up to 25,000 watchtowers are estimated to have been constructed on the wall . As Mongol raids continued periodically over the years , the Ming devoted considerable resources to repair and reinforce the walls . Sections near the Ming capital of Beijing were especially strong . Qi Jiguang between 1567 and 1570 also repaired and reinforced the wall , faced sections of the ram - earth wall with bricks and constructed 1,200 watchtowers from Shanhaiguan Pass to Changping to warn of approaching Mongol raiders . During the 1440s -- 1460s , the Ming also built a so - called `` Liaodong Wall '' . Similar in function to the Great Wall ( whose extension , in a sense , it was ) , but more basic in construction , the Liaodong Wall enclosed the agricultural heartland of the Liaodong province , protecting it against potential incursions by Jurched - Mongol Oriyanghan from the northwest and the Jianzhou Jurchens from the north . While stones and tiles were used in some parts of the Liaodong Wall , most of it was in fact simply an earth dike with moats on both sides .",

Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC ; these , later joined together and made bigger and stronger , are collectively referred to as the Great Wall . Especially famous is the wall built in 220 -- 206 BC by Qin Shi Huang , the first Emperor of China . Little of that wall remains . The Great Wall has been rebuilt , maintained , and enhanced over various dynasties ; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 -- 1644 ) .",

      "text": "Great Wall of China\nThe longer Chinese name `` Ten - Thousand Mile Long Wall '' ( \u842c\u91cc \u9577\u57ce , Wanli Changcheng ) came from Sima Qian 's description of it in the Records , though he did not name the walls as such . The AD 493 Book of Song quotes the frontier general Tan Daoji referring to `` the long wall of 10,000 miles '' , closer to the modern name , but the name rarely features in pre-modern times otherwise . The traditional Chinese mile ( \u91cc , l\u01d0 ) was an often irregular distance that was intended to show the length of a standard village and varied with terrain but was usually standardized at distances around a third of an English mile ( 540 m ) . Since China 's metrication in 1930 , it has been exactly equivalent to 500 metres or 1,600 feet , which would make the wall 's name describe a distance of 5,000 km ( 3,100 mi ) . However , this use of `` ten - thousand '' ( w\u00e0n ) is figurative in a similar manner to the Greek and English myriad and simply means `` innumerable '' or `` immeasurable '' .",

Sometime between 1190 and 1196 , during Zhangzong 's reign , the high official Zhang Wangong ( \u5f35\u842c\u516c ) and the Censorate recommended that work on the wall be indefinitely suspended due to a recent drought , noting : `` What has been begun is already being flattened by sandstorms , and bullying the people into defence works will simply exhaust them . '' However , Chancellor Wanyan Xiang ( \u5b8c \u984f \u8944 ) convinced the emperor of the walls ' merits based on an optimistic cost estimate -- `` Although the initial outlay for the walls will be one million strings of cash , when the work is done the frontier will be secure with only half the present number of soldiers needed to defend it , which means that every year you will save three million strings of cash ... The benefits will be everlasting '' -- and so construction continued unabated . All this work created an extensive systems of walls , which consisted of a 700 kilometres ( 430 mi ) `` outer wall '' from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a 1,000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) network of `` inner walls '' north and northeast of Beijing . Together , they formed a roughly elliptical web of fortifications 1,400 kilometres ( 870 mi ) in length and 440 kilometres ( 270 mi ) in diameter . Some of these walls had inner moats ( from 10 to 60 metres ( 33 to 197 feet ) in width ) , beacon towers , battlements , parapets , and outward - facing semicircular platforms protruding from the wall -- features that set the Jin walls apart from their predecessors .",

Troops were re-deployed along the outer line , new walls and beacon towers were constructed , and fortifications were restored and extended along both lines . Firearms and artillery were mounted on the walls and towers during this time , for both defence and signalling purposes . The project 's completion was announced in the sixth month of 1548 .

Over the course of the year 555 alone , 1.8 million men were mobilized to build the Juyong Pass and extend its wall by 450 kilometres ( 280 mi ) through Datong to the eastern banks of the Yellow River . In 557 a secondary wall was built inside the main one . These walls were built quickly from local earth and stones or formed by natural barriers . Two stretches of the stone - and - earth Qi wall still stand in Shanxi today , measuring 3.3 metres ( 11 ft ) wide at their bases and 3.5 metres ( 11 ft ) high on average . In 577 the Northern Zhou conquered the Northern Qi and in 580 made repairs to the existing Qi walls . The route of the Qi and Zhou walls would be mostly followed by the later Ming wall west of Gubeikou , which includes reconstructed walls from Qi and Zhou . In more recent times , the reddish remnants of the Zhou ramparts in Hebei gave rise to the nickname `` Red Wall '' .",
