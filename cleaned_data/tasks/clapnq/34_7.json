  "gold_answer": "No, I didn't say that eating meat is not good for those who play sports. Ancient Greek athletes were known to follow a diet that was primarily based on meat. However, modern sports nutrition emphasizes a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from all food groups, including carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Meat can be a good source of protein  , as well as iron , zinc , and vitamin B12 . Meats , poultry , and fish include beef , chicken , pork , salmon , tuna , shrimp , and eggs .",
