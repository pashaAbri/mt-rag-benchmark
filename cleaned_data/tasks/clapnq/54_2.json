  "gold_answer": "The West Branch is home to many types of fish, such as landlocked salmon and brook trout. There are many deep pools within the river due to the many slate ledges, making the river ideal for fishing from shore, although there are still areas that are good for canoe fishing. The West Branch is a world-class landlocked salmon river, while the East Branch is known for its smallmouth bass fishery. In 2008, the Atlantic Salmon Commission opened the main stem of the river to catch and release fly fishing for Atlantic salmon.",

There are many deep pools within the river , due to the many slate ledges , making the river ideal for fishing from shore , though there are still areas that are good for canoe fishing . The river is great for a day fishing trip , however there are a few campsites located sporadically around for people who wish to stay more than one day . With the Ripogenus Dam by Chesuncook Lake , the West Branch is able to sustain the large landlocked salmon found there , with twelve miles of heavy rapids , deep runs , large pools , and slower moving water in some sections . Baxter State Park to the north adds to the natural beauty of the area , and natural protection as well .",
