  "gold_answer": "Meng Tian was a Chinese general and politician who served under Emperor Qin Shi Huang during the Qin Dynasty. He is best known for leading the northern expedition against the Xiongnu people. Meng Tian was responsible for building and extending the Great Wall of China along the empire's northern border. Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories. When Meng Tian's settlements in the north were abandoned, the Xiongnu nomads moved back into the Ordos Loop as the Qin empire became consumed by widespread rebellion. Upon Qin Shi Huang's death in 210 BC, Meng Tian was ordered to commit suicide in a succession conspiracy.",

Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC ; these , later joined together and made bigger and stronger , are collectively referred to as the Great Wall . Especially famous is the wall built in 220 -- 206 BC by Qin Shi Huang , the first Emperor of China . Little of that wall remains . The Great Wall has been rebuilt , maintained , and enhanced over various dynasties ; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 -- 1644 ) .",

Originally, it was mainly constructed from rammed earth, stones, and wood. During the Ming Dynasty (1368--1644), bricks became heavily used, along with materials such as tiles, lime, and stone. The bricks were easier to work with, could bear more weight, and endured better than rammed earth.\n|user|: How long is the Wall?\n|assistant|: The frontier walls built by different dynasties have multiple courses. Collectively, they stretch from Dandong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, from present - day Sino - Russian border in the north to Qinghai in the south. The walls built by the Ming dynasty measure 8,850 km. Faced with the threat of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks from the north, the Qi built up to 3,000 li about 1,600 kilometers. The Xuan - Da portion of the Great Wall totaled about 850 kilometers of wall, with some sections being doubled - up with two lines of wall, some tripled or even quadrupled. Chancellor Wanyan Xiang convinced the emperor to build an extensive systems of walls, which consisted of a 700 kilometers outer wall from Heilongjiang to Mongolia and a 1,000 kilometers network of inner walls, north and northeast of Beijing.

Towards the end of the Ming, the Great Wall helped defend the empire against the Manchu invasions that began around 1600. The usefulness of the Great Wall as a defense line against northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the Great Wall became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes.

Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords , he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire. Contrary to the building of the outer walls, which were built to stabilize the newly united China, the inner walls threatened the unity of the empire. In the north, the state of Wei and the Yiqu built walls to protect themselves from Qin aggression, but were still unable to stop Qin from eating into their territories.

During the Ming , however , bricks were heavily used in many areas of the wall , as were materials such as tiles , lime , and stone . The size and weight of the bricks made them easier to work with than earth and stone , so construction quickened . Additionally , bricks could bear more weight and endure better than rammed earth . Stone can hold under its own weight better than brick , but is more difficult to use . Consequently , stones cut in rectangular shapes were used for the foundation , inner and outer brims , and gateways of the wall . Battlements line the uppermost portion of the vast majority of the wall , with defensive gaps a little over 30 cm ( 12 in ) tall , and about 23 cm ( 9.1 in ) wide . From the parapets , guards could survey the surrounding land . Communication between the army units along the length of the Great Wall , including the ability to call reinforcements and warn garrisons of enemy movements , was of high importance . Signal towers were built upon hill tops or other high points along the wall for their visibility . Wooden gates could be used as a trap against those going through . Barracks , stables , and armories were built near the wall 's inner surface .",

      "text": "Great Wall of China\nKing Zheng of Qin conquered the last of his opponents and unified China as the First Emperor of the Qin dynasty ( `` Qin Shi Huang '' ) in 221 BC . Intending to impose centralized rule and prevent the resurgence of feudal lords , he ordered the destruction of the sections of the walls that divided his empire among the former states . To position the empire against the Xiongnu people from the north , however , he ordered the building of new walls to connect the remaining fortifications along the empire 's northern frontier . `` Build and move on '' was a central guiding principle in constructing the wall , implying that the Chinese were not erecting a permanently fixed border . Transporting the large quantity of materials required for construction was difficult , so builders always tried to use local resources . Stones from the mountains were used over mountain ranges , while rammed earth was used for construction in the plains . There are no surviving historical records indicating the exact length and course of the Qin walls . Most of the ancient walls have eroded away over the centuries , and very few sections remain today . The human cost of the construction is unknown , but it has been estimated by some authors that hundreds of thousands , if not up to a million , workers died building the Qin wall . Later , the Han , the Sui , and the Northern dynasties all repaired , rebuilt , or expanded sections of the Great Wall at great cost to defend themselves against northern invaders . The Tang and Song dynasties did not undertake any significant effort in the region . The Liao , Jin , and Yuan dynasties , who ruled Northern China throughout most of the 10th -- 13th centuries , constructed defensive walls in the 12th century but those were located much to the north of the Great Wall as we know it , within China 's province of Inner Mongolia and in Mongolia itself .",

These conquests , combined with the Legalist reforms started by Shang Yang in the 4th century BC , transformed China from a loose confederation of feudal states to an authoritarian empire . With the transformation , Qin became able to command a far greater assembly of labourers to be used in public works than the prior feudal kingdoms . Also , once unification was achieved , Qin found itself in possession of a large professional army with no more internal enemies to fight and thus had to find a new use for them . Soon after the conquests , in the year 215 BC , the emperor sent the famed general Meng Tian to the Ordos region to drive out the Xiongnu nomads settled there , who had risen from beyond the fallen marginal states along the northern frontier . Qin 's campaign against the Xiongnu was preemptive in nature , since there was no pressing nomadic menace to be faced at the time ; its aim was to annexe the ambiguous territories of the Ordos and to clearly define the Qin 's northern borders . Once the Xiongnu were chased away , Meng Tian introduced 30,000 settler families to colonize the newly conquered territories .",
