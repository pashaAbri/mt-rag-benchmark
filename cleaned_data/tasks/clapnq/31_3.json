  "input": "What about HIV pandemic? did it kill many people?",
  "gold_answer": "Yes, the HIV pandemic has also had a significant global impact. Approximately 38.6 million people are living with HIV worldwide, and there have been around 25 million deaths caused by AIDS since it was first recognized on 5 June 1981 , making it one of the most destructive epidemics in recorded history . It is estimated that in  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  about 1.1 % of adults aged 15 -- 49 were living with HIV / AIDS .   According to the 2015 UNAIDS Report , South Africa has an estimated 7 million people living with HIV -- more than any other country in the world . A 2008 study revealed that HIV / AIDS infection in South Africa is distinctly divided along racial lines : 13.6 % of blacks are HIV - positive , whereas only 0.3 % of whites have the disease . Most deaths are experienced by economically active individuals , resulting in many AIDS orphans who in many cases depend on the state for care and financial support                                     ",

During the outbreak from 1900 - 1904 in San Francisco is when authorities made permanent the Chinese Exclusion Act . This law was originally signed into existence by President Chester A. Arthur in 1882 . The Chinese Exclusion Act was supposed to last for ten years but was renewed in 1892 with the Geary Act and subsequently made permanent in 1902 during the outbreak of plague in Chinatown , San Francisco . The last major outbreak in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924 , though the disease is still present in wild rodents , and can be passed to humans that come in contact with them . According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was considered active until 1959 , when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year . In 1994 , a plague outbreak in five Indian states caused an estimated 700 infections ( including 52 deaths ) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague .",

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease . The yellow fever virus vaccine , a live - attenuated strain called 17D , is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated . Antiviral",
