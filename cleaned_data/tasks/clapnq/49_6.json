      "text": "American football\nAmerican football evolved in the United States , originating from the sports of association football ( known in the U.S. as soccer ) and rugby football . The first match of American football was played on November 6 , 1869 , between two college teams , Rutgers and Princeton , under rules based on the association football rules of the time . During the latter half of the 1870s , colleges playing association football switched to the Rugby Union code , which allowed carrying the ball . A set of rule changes drawn up from 1880 onward by Walter Camp , the `` Father of American Football '' , established the snap , eleven - player teams , and the concept of downs ; later rule changes legalized the forward pass , created the neutral zone , and specified the size and shape of the football . The sport is closely related to Canadian football , which evolved parallel and contemporary to the American game , and most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football .",
