  "input": "Can you tell me the greatest pandemics worldwide before  COVID in 2020?",
  "gold_answer": "Yes, a number of pandemics have affected the world before COVID. The 1918 flu pandemic , which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 influenza pandemic caused by an unusually severe and deadly influenza A virus . The victims were healthy young adults , in contrast to most influenza outbreaks , which predominantly affect juvenile , elderly , or otherwise - weakened patients . Older estimates say it killed 40 -- 50 million people , while more recent research suggests that it may have killed as many as 100 million people , or 5 % of the world 's population in 1918. The third bubonic plague pandemic, also known as the modern pandemic, spread the bubonic plague disease to port cities throughout the world in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century via shipping routes . The bubonic plague affected people in Chinatown in San Francisco from 1900 - 1904, and the people of Oakland and east bay again from 1907 - 1909. In 1994, Zimbabwe suffered outbreaks of acute diseases like plague. In 2014, West African had the Ebola virus epidemic. In 2001 the Bubonic plague affected Zambia , India , Malawi , Algeria , China , Peru , and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .   2009 saw a pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus (swine flu). These are just some examples of other modern-day pandemics.               ",

Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live - attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease . The yellow fever virus vaccine , a live - attenuated strain called 17D , is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated . Antiviral",

The vaccine is infectious which improves its effectiveness , but causes serious complications for people with impaired immune systems ( for example chemotherapy and AIDS patients , and people with eczema ) , and is not yet considered safe for pregnant women . A woman planning on conceiving within one month should not receive the smallpox immunization until after the pregnancy . In the event of an outbreak , the woman should delay pregnancy if possible . Vaccines that only contain attenuated vaccinia viruses ( an attenuated virus is one in which the pathogenicity has been decreased through serial passage ) have been proposed , but some researchers have questioned the possible effectiveness of such a vaccine . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , `` vaccination within 3 days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms in the vast majority of people . Vaccination 4 to 7 days after exposure likely offers some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease . '' This , along with vaccinations of so - called first - responders , is the current plan of action being devised by the United States Department of Homeland Security ( including Federal Emergency Management Agency ) in the United States .",

The last major outbreak in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924 , though the disease is still present in wild rodents , and can be passed to humans that come in contact with them . According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was considered active until 1959 , when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year . In 1994 , a plague outbreak in five Indian states caused an estimated 700 infections ( including 52 deaths ) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague .",
