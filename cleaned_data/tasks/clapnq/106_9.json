  "gold_answer": "The American Civil War was a significant and devastating conflict in the history of the United States. In fact, the American Civil War is sometimes called the `` first modern war '' due to the mobilization and destruction of the civilian base -- total war -- and due to by many technical military innovations involving railroads , telegraphs , rifles , trench warfare , and ironclad warships with turret guns .. Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 people dead , more than the number of U.S. military deaths in all other wars combined ( at least until approximately the Vietnam War ) . Much of the South 's infrastructure was destroyed , especially the transportation systems , railroads , mills , and houses . The Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and 4 million slaves were freed . The Reconstruction Era ( 1863 -- 1877 ) overlapped and followed the war , with the process of restoring national unity , strengthening the national government , and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country.

      "text": "Climate of North Carolina\nSnow in North Carolina is seen on a regular basis in the mountains . North Carolina averages 5 inches ( 130 mm ) of snow a year . However , this also varies greatly across the state . Along the coast , most areas register less than 2 inches ( 51 mm ) per year while the state capital , Raleigh averages 7.5 inches ( 190 mm ) . Farther west in the Piedmont - Triad , the average grows to approximately 9 inches ( 230 mm ) . The Charlotte area averages approximately 6.5 inches ( 170 mm ) . The mountains in the west act as a barrier , preventing most snowstorms from entering the Piedmont . When snow does make it past the mountains , it is usually light and is seldom on the ground for more than two or three days . However , several storms have dropped 18 inches ( 460 mm ) or more of snow within normally warm areas . The 1993 Storm of the Century that lasted from March 11 to March 15 affected locales from Canada to Central America , and brought a significant amount of snow to North Carolina . Newfound Gap received more than 36 inches ( 0.91 m ) of snow with drifts more than 5 feet ( 1.5 m ) , while Mount Mitchell measured over 4 feet ( 1.2 m ) of snow with drifts to 14 feet ( 4.3 m ) . Most of the northwestern part of the state received somewhere between 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) an 3 feet ( 0.91 m ) of snow .",

                  "model_text": "|user|: where does it snow the most in north carolina?\n|assistant|: The mountains in western North Carolina receive the most snow in the state. This is because the Appalachian Mountains act as a barrier, preventing most snowstorms from entering the Piedmont. When snow does make it past the mountains, it is usually light and is seldom on the ground for more than two or three days. However, several storms have dropped 18 inches (460 mm) or more of snow within normally warm areas. For instance, during the 1993 Storm of the Century, most of the northwestern part of the state received somewhere between 2 feet (0.61 m) and 3 feet (0.91 m) of snow. In January of 2000, Raleigh area was hit with more than  20 inches(510 mm) of snow feel. There was also a heavy snowfall totaling 18 inches ( 460 mm ) that hit the Wilmington area on December 22 - 23 , 1989\n|user|: That means North Carolina has most the time tough winters with some much snow. What can you tell me about the  summer months. Are they enyoyable ?\n|assistant|:  I cannot definitively say whether the summer months in North Carolina are enjoyable or not, as relative humidity is highest in the winter suggesting  that the summer months might be less humid.  There is an average of forty - five inches of rain a year ( fifty in the mountains ) . July storms account for much of this precipitation .In fact, North Carolina experience severe weather in  both summer and winter. The summer can bring the threat of hurricanes , tropical storms , heavy rain , and flooding . Indeed Destructive hurricanes that have hit North Carolina include Hurricane Fran , Hurricane Floyd , and Hurricane Hazel , the latter being the strongest storm ever to make landfall in the state , as a Category 4 in 1954 . Hurricane Isabel ranks as the most destructive of the 21st century .\n|user|: Are you saying the North Carolina can get a lot  hurricane during the summer months?\n|assistant|: That is right. North Carolina, located along the Atlantic Coast, is no stranger to hurricanes and it can experience a significant number of hurricanes during the summer months. Many of them can come up from the Caribbean Sea make it up the coast of eastern America , passing by North Carolina . The state has had destructive hurricanes in the past, such as Hurricane Fran, considered as category 3 hurricane  and caused a huge financial damage ;hurricane Floyd in 1999, which dropped over 24 inches of rainfall in the north of Southport, causing the death of more than 35 people and Hurricane Hazel, which was the strongest storm ever to make landfall in North Carolina as a Category 4 in 1954 and caused 19 deaths and also serious destruction. Additionally, Hurricane Isabel is the most destructive hurricane of the 21st century in the state.\n|user|: As Winter and summer are tough seasons with snow and hurricane, tornadoes, what can you tell me about spring and fall?\n|assistant|: Because the  El Ni\u00f1o  early spring can see  temperatures cooler than average with above average precipitation in the central and eastern parts of the state and drier weather in the western parts. It important to note the Tornadoes are most likely in the spring and the month of May experiences the greatest rise in temperatures . there are warm days and cool nights in the Piedmont during the spring with temperatures  somewhat cooler in the mountains and warmer , particularly at night , near the coast and the humidity is lowest .  In the fall you can see the most rapidly change of temperature, especially in October and November although tropical cyclones remain a threat until late in the season.  Due to the leaves changing color in the trees ,the Appalachian Mountains are frequently visited at this time of year ,\n|user|:  Appalachian Mountains\n|assistant|: The western section of North Carolina is part of the Appalachian Mountain range . Among the subranges of the Appalachians located in the state are the Great Smoky Mountains , Blue Ridge Mountains , which is a specific region of the Appalachians  with the ridgeline of the mountains varying from being 5 to 65 miles wide , with peaks averaging around 2000 to 4000 ft above sea level . The area is covered in forests with hundreds of species of trees found within the range , and today are a source of timber . Additionally we have Black Mountains, considered the  highest in the eastern United States , and culminate in Mount Mitchell at 6,684 feet ( 2,037 m ) , the highest point east of the Mississippi River. In fact, The Appalachian Mountains divide the eastern seaboard from the Great Lakes and the grasslands of the Midwest .  Every year the Appalachian Mountains attract several million tourists to the Western part of the state , including the historic Biltmore Estate . The scenic Blue Ridge Parkway and Great Smoky Mountains National Park are the two most visited national park and unit in the United States.  And also the Stone Mountain Stone Mountain is part of the e Appalachian Mountains.\n|user|: What could you tell me overall about North Carollina like its economy ?\n|assistant|: As North Carolina has a great availability of hydroelectric power  and a wide variety of soils , its economy is  very diverse leading the South Atlantic states in industry and agriculture. In fact, the state leads the nation in the production of tobacco , textiles , and furniture. Charlotte , the state 's largest city , is a major textile and trade center. The state 's shipping , commercial fishing , and lumber industries are important to its economy . Service industries , including education , health care , private research , and retail trade , are also important . Research Triangle Park , a large industrial complex located in the Raleigh - Durham area , is one of the major centers in the country for electronics and medical researchHowever, there has been a clear division in the economic growth of North Carolina 's urban and rural areas . While North Carolina 's urban areas have enjoyed a prosperous economy with steady job growth , low unemployment , and rising wages , many of the state 's rural counties have suffered from job loss , rising levels of poverty , and population loss as their manufacturing base has declined. It is important to note that Tourism has also been a boon for the North Carolina economy as people flock to the Outer Banks coastal area and the Appalachian Mountains anchored by Asheville .\n|user|: Speaking of North Carolina, its weather, economy, what can you tell me about its participation in the American Revolution.\n|assistant|: North Carolina played a significant role in the American Revolution. In fact,  on April 12, of 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the Continental Congress to vote for independence from the British Crown , through the Halifax Resolves passed by the North Carolina Provincial Congress .In May , Congress called on all the states to write constitutions and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule . A major American victory in the war took place at King 's Mountain along the North Carolina -- South Carolina border ; on October 7 , 1780 , a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina ( including what is today the state of Tennessee ) and southwest Virginia overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson .  The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence. In a few words,  America 's independence from Great Britain  was led through North Carolina .\n|user|: And about North Carolina involvement in the US Civil war.\n|assistant|: North Carolina also played a significant role in the US Civil War. Initially, North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy . Some of the yeoman farmers in the state 's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War , while some covertly supported the Union cause during the conflict . In May 20 , 1861 , North Carolina  was the last of the Confederate states to declare secession from the Union , 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession. North Carolina Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia , the Confederacy 's most famous army . It provided the Confederacy with at least 125,000 troops , which is far more than any other state did   The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville , which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman 's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865 . In April 1865 , after losing the Battle of Morrisville , Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place , in what is today Durham . North Carolina 's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union , in February 1865 , after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher , its major defense downriver .\n|user|: I see.

There was also a heavy snowfall totaling 18 inches ( 460 mm ) that hit the Wilmington area on December 22 - 23 , 1989 . This storm affected only the Southeastern US coast , as far south as Savannah , GA , with little to no snow measured west of I - 95 . Most big snows that impact areas east of the mountains come from extratropical cyclones which approach from the south across Georgia and South Carolina and move off the coast of North or South Carolina . These storms typically throw Gulf or Atlantic moisture over cold Arctic air at ground level , usually propelled southward from Arctic high pressure over the Northeastern or New England states . If the storms track sufficiently far to the east , snow will be limited to the eastern part of the state ( as with the December 22 - 23 , 1989 storm ) . If the cyclones travel close to the coast , warm air will get pulled into eastern North Carolina due to increasing flow off the milder Atlantic Ocean , bringing a rain / snow line well inland with heavy snow restricted to the Piedmont , foothills and mountains , as with the January 22 , 1987 storm . If the storm tracks inland into eastern North Carolina , the rain / snow line ranges between Raleigh and Greensboro .",

In fact,  on April 12, of 1776, the colony became the first to instruct its delegates to the Continental Congress to vote for independence from the British Crown , through the Halifax Resolves passed by the North Carolina Provincial Congress .In May , Congress called on all the states to write constitutions and eliminate the last remnants of royal rule . A major American victory in the war took place at King 's Mountain along the North Carolina -- South Carolina border ; on October 7 , 1780 , a force of 1000 mountain men from western North Carolina ( including what is today the state of Tennessee ) and southwest Virginia overwhelmed a force of some 1000 British troops led by Major Patrick Ferguson .  The American victory at Kings Mountain gave the advantage to colonists who favored American independence. In a few words,  America 's independence from Great Britain  was led through North Carolina .\n|user|: And about North Carolina involvement in the US Civil war.\n|assistant|: North Carolina also played a significant role in the US Civil War. Initially, North Carolinians refused to support the Confederacy . Some of the yeoman farmers in the state 's mountains and western Piedmont region remained neutral during the Civil War , while some covertly supported the Union cause during the conflict . In May 20 , 1861 , North Carolina  was the last of the Confederate states to declare secession from the Union , 13 days after the Tennessee legislature voted for secession. North Carolina Confederate troops from all parts of North Carolina served in all the major battles of the Army of Northern Virginia , the Confederacy 's most famous army . It provided the Confederacy with at least 125,000 troops , which is far more than any other state did   The largest battle fought in North Carolina was at Bentonville , which was a futile attempt by Confederate General Joseph Johnston to slow Union General William Tecumseh Sherman 's advance through the Carolinas in the spring of 1865 . In April 1865 , after losing the Battle of Morrisville , Johnston surrendered to Sherman at Bennett Place , in what is today Durham . North Carolina 's port city of Wilmington was the last Confederate port to fall to the Union , in February 1865 , after the Union won the nearby Second Battle of Fort Fisher , its major defense downriver .\n|user|: I see. What a terrible war ! "

      "text": "American Civil War\nThe Union and Confederacy quickly raised volunteer and conscription armies that fought mostly in the South over four years . The Union finally won the war when General Robert E. Lee surrendered to General Ulysses S. Grant at the Battle of Appomattox Court House , followed by a series of surrenders by Confederate generals throughout the southern states . Four years of intense combat left 620,000 to 750,000 people dead , more than the number of U.S. military deaths in all other wars combined ( at least until approximately the Vietnam War ) . Much of the South 's infrastructure was destroyed , especially the transportation systems , railroads , mills , and houses . The Confederacy collapsed , slavery was abolished , and 4 million slaves were freed . The Reconstruction Era ( 1863 -- 1877 ) overlapped and followed the war , with the process of restoring national unity , strengthening the national government , and granting civil rights to freed slaves throughout the country . The Civil War is the most studied and written about episode in U.S. history .",
