Its drainage basin is 3,530 square miles ( 9,100 km ) in area . The name `` Androscoggin '' comes from the Eastern Abenaki term / al\u0259ss\u00edk\u0251nt\u0259kw / or / als\u00edk\u0251nt\u0259kw / , meaning `` river of cliff rock shelters '' ( literally `` thus - deep - dwelling - river '' ) ; or perhaps from Penobscot / al\u0259sstk\u0251t\u0259kw / , meaning `` river of rock shelters '' . The Anglicization of the Abenaki term is likely an analogical contamination with the colonial governor Edmund Andros .",
