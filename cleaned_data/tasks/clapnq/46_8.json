Christianity became more associated with the Empire , resulting in persecution for Christians living outside of the empire , as their rulers feared Christians would revolt in favor of the Emperor . In 385 , this new legal authority of the Church resulted in the first use of capital punishment being pronounced as a sentence upon a Christian ' heretic ' , namely Priscillian .",

In 313 , the struggles of the Early Church were lessened by the legalisation of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I. In 380 , under Emperor Theodosius I , Catholicism became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the decree of the Emperor , which would persist until the fall of the Western Empire , and later , with the Eastern Roman Empire , until the Fall of Constantinople . During this time , the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils , there were considered five primary sees ( jurisdictions within the Catholic Church ) according to Eusebius : Rome , Constantinople , Antioch , Jerusalem and Alexandria , known as the Pentarchy .",
