      "text": "Quit India Movement\nThe Cripps Mission had failed , and on August 1942 , Gandhi made a call to Do or Die in his Quit India speech delivered in Bombay at the Gowalia Tank Maidan . The All - India Congress Committee launched a mass protest demanding what Gandhi called `` An Orderly British Withdrawal '' from India . Even though it was wartime , the British were prepared to act . Almost the entire leadership of the Indian National Congress was imprisoned without trial within hours of Gandhi 's speech . Most spent the rest of the war in prison and out of contact with the masses . The British had the support of the Viceroy 's Council ( which had a majority of Indians ) , of the All India Muslim League , the princely states , the Indian Imperial Police , the British Indian Army and the Indian Civil Service . Many Indian businessmen profiting from heavy wartime spending did not support the Quit India Movement . Many students paid more attention to Subhas Chandra Bose , who was in exile and supporting the Axis Powers . The only outside support came from the Americans , as President Franklin D. Roosevelt pressured Prime Minister Winston Churchill to give in to some of the Indian demands . The Quit India campaign was effectively crushed . The British refused to grant immediate independence , saying it could happen only after the war had ended .",
