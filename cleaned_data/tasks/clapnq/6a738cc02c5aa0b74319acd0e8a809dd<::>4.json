It can cause DNA damaging of the cells in the testicles or ovaries that produce sperm and eggs, potentially leading to reduced fertility or even sterility.",

The damaged DNA related to infertility manifests itself by the increased susceptibility to denaturation inducible by heat or acid and / or by the presence of double - strand breaks that can be detected by the TUNEL assay . General factors Diabetes mellitus , thyroid disorders , undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease , adrenal disease Hypothalamic - pituitary factors Hyperprolactinemia Hypopituitarism The presence of anti-thyroid antibodies is associated with an increased risk of unexplained subfertility with an odds ratio of 1.5 and 95 % confidence interval of 1.1 -- 2.0 . Environmental factors Toxins such as glues , volatile organic solvents or silicones , physical agents , chemical dusts , and pesticides . Tobacco smokers are 60 % more likely to be infertile than non-smokers .",

Women may experience premature ovarian failure and stop producing viable eggs during their reproductive years . Some women may be born without ovaries .
