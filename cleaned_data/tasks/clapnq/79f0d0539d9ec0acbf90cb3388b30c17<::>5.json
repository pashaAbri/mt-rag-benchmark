  "gold_answer": "Besides those areas of trade  that was mentioned before, the Celts were were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon , through the cultures of Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne . The Celtic languages were also important to form  a branch of the larger Indo - European family . By the time speakers of Celtic languages entered history around 400 BC , they were already split into several language groups , and spread over much of Western continental Europe , the Iberian Peninsula , Ireland and Britain . They depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship , although this may only have been a particular late phase of organization in Celtic societies . It is also important to note that the Celts depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship , although this may only have been a particular late phase of organization in Celtic societies .
