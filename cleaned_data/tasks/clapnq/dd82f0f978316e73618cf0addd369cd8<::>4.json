  "input": "Talking about soccer, Can you name the best soccer players of all the time?",
  "gold_answer": "Yes. I can provide some names of the most renowned soccer players of all time. For instance Zinedine Zidane, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are the only players to haves been named FIFA World Player of the Year. Zidane has received that honor three times. In 2002 , ESPN described Zidane as the greatest player in the world in the world 's biggest game . In 2004 , he was voted UEFA Best European Player of the Past 50 Years , and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world 's greatest living players . Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are considered to be the two best players of their generation. Ronaldo has four FIFA Ballon d'Or awards , the most for a European player, and is the first player in history to win four European Golden Shoes. He has scored more than 600 senior career goals for club and country. Pel\u00e9 is considered the  best soccer player of the last century. In the late 1990s, France Football elected Pel\u00e9 the Football Player of the Century.",

      "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nMajor League Soccer 's first all - star game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996 . The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .",
