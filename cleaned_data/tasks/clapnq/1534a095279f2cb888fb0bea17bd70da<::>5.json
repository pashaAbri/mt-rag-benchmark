  "gold_answer": "Yes, there are other types of aviation photography. These include ground-static photography, which involves taking pictures of aircraft on the ground, and remote photography, where the camera is mounted onto the external aircraft structure away from the photographer and is triggered remotely using a mechanical or electrical shutter release .",

Types of aviation photography include air - to - air , ground - to - air , ground - static , and remote photography . Military aviation photography , especially air - to - air , requires additional skills , as the photo and target aircraft often fly at velocities of over Mach 1 , while under moderate to high G .",

This type of photography is common at airshows or airports.\n|user|: No, I meant photos in the air.\n|assistant|: Air - to - air aviation photography is the art of photographing aircraft in the air, while using another aircraft as a photo platform.\n|user|: So does that mean pilot of the second aircraft also acts as a photographer?\n|assistant|: I am sorry I don't have any specific knowledge about who acts as a photographer in air-to-air aviation photography. \n|user|: Is air-to-air phtography more difficult that ground-to-air?\n|assistant|: Air-to-air military aviation photography,  requires additional skills , as the photo and target aircraft often fly at velocities of over Mach 1, while under moderate to high G . On the other hand, a long focus photographic lens is necessary due to the greater distance between the photographer and the target aircraft in ground-to-air settings. Thus is it hard to say if one is more difficult than other conclusively.\n|user|: are there any other types of aviation photography?"

Photos can be of aircraft exteriors , interiors , and aircraft details . The photographer has full control over lighting , aircraft placement , camera angles , and background . Involving other subjects such as the pilot or other aircraft is much easier to accomplish in ground - static photography than in other forms of aerial photography .",

The image has to be composed when the aircraft is on the ground , because the photographer has no access to the camera while the aircraft is in flight . Much brainstorming and planning must be done while setting up the camera to get the desired shot . Remote photography is the least common type of aviation photography .",
