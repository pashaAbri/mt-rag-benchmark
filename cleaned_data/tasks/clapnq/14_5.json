      "text": "Vallabhbhai Patel\nHistorians believe that Patel 's speech was instrumental in electrifying nationalists , who up to then had been skeptical of the proposed rebellion . Patel 's organising work in this period is credited by historians with ensuring the success of the rebellion across India . Patel was arrested on 9 August and was imprisoned with the entire Congress Working Committee from 1942 to 1945 at the fort in Ahmednagar . Here he spun cloth , played bridge , read a large number of books , took long walks , and practised gardening . He also provided emotional support to his colleagues while awaiting news and developments from the outside . Patel was deeply pained at the news of the deaths of Mahadev Desai and Kasturba Gandhi later that year . But Patel wrote in a letter to his daughter that he and his colleagues were experiencing `` fullest peace '' for having done `` their duty '' . Even though other political parties had opposed the struggle and the British had employed ruthless means of suppression , the Quit India movement was `` by far the most serious rebellion since that of 1857 '' , as the viceroy cabled to Winston Churchill . More than 100,000 people were arrested and many were killed in violent struggles with the police . Strikes , protests , and other revolutionary activities had broken out across India . When Patel was released on 15 June 1945 , he realised that the British were preparing proposals to transfer power to India .",

      "text": "Mama and papa\nThough amma and appa are used in Tulu , they are not really Tulu words but used due to the influence of neighboring states ' languages . The actual words for mother in Tulu is appe pronounced IPA : ( ape ) and the word for father in Tulu is amme pronounced IPA : ( am\u00e6 ) . Note that the usage of these words is at odds with the usage pattern in other languages ( similar to Georgian in that sense ) . In Telugu , `` Thalli '' and `` Thandri '' are used for mother and father in formal Telugu . Amma and nana are used for mother and father for the informal way . Notice how nana refers to maternal grandfather in Hindi , and how that differs from its Telugu meaning . `` Nayana '' is also used for father in informal Telugu in the Rayalaseema region of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana of India . In Malayalam , `` Amma '' is used for mother . Hindus use `` Achan '' ( \u0d05\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1b\u0d7b ) for father and Christians use `` Appan '' . `` Appan '' was also previously used by matriarchal Hindu castes to denote the mother 's husband who may or may not be the biological father . The word `` Achan '' is a transformed Malayalam equivalent of the Sanskrit `` Arya '' for `` Sir / Master '' ( Arya - ajja - > ayya ) . `` Achan '' gained almost universal acceptance as the word for father among most Hindus during the 20th century . However , some families and communities also use ' appa ' etc. at least within their circles . The Malayali Christian communities often use a different set of words for father such as chaachchan ( \u0d1a\u0d3e\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d7b ) , appachan ( \u0d05\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d7b ) etc . The Muslim communities use vaappa ( \u0d35\u0d3e\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a ) , vaappachchi ( \u0d35\u0d3e\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d3f ) , uppa ( \u0d09\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a ) etc . In Tamil , `` Thai '' and `` Thanthai '' are the formal Tamil words for mother and father ; informally Amma and Appa are much more common words for mother and father respectively . In the Kannada language , `` Thaai '' for mother and `` Thande '' for father are used formally . But to address them informally Kannadigas use amma or abbe for mother and appa for father .",
