  "gold_answer": "The archaeological discoveries helped to shaped the way European colonialists identified with the artifacts and the ancient people who made them . For instance, colonial Europe 's mission in Egypt was able to bring the glory and magnificence of ancient Egypt closer to Europe and incorporate it into knowledge of world history , putting that country  new spotlight . With the archaeological discoveries , ancient Egypt was adopted into the Western historical narrative and came to take on a significance that had up until that time been reserved for ancient Greek and Roman civilization . Also  , historians of the pre-Columbian period mainly interpreted the records of the European conquerors and the accounts of early European travelers and antiquaries .",

With the archaeological discoveries , ancient Egypt was adopted into the Western historical narrative and came to take on a significance that had up until that time been reserved for ancient Greek and Roman civilization . The French revolutionaries justified the large - scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome , in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization ; by the same token , the appropriation of ancient Egyptian history as European history further legitimated Western colonial rule over Egypt . But while ancient Egypt became patrimony of the West , modern Egypt remained a part of the Muslim world . The writings of European archaeologists and tourists illustrate the impression that modern Egyptians were uncivilized , savage , and the antithesis of the splendor of ancient Egypt .",
