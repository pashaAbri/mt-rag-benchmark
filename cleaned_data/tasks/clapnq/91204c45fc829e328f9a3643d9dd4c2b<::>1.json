It can also be used to detect magic in use anywhere in the world and provide Strange with a location and visual . The orb rests in Doctor Strange 's Sanctum Sanctorum in a room called the Chamber of Shadows . It usually is inside a display case with three curved legs . When summoned , the glass covering rises and the ball levitates . While powerful , the Orb has been blocked by exceptionally powerful mystic forces ( such as Umar ) who do not want their exact location known . On at least one occasion , it has been used to open a dimensional portal to the realm of Agamotto .",
