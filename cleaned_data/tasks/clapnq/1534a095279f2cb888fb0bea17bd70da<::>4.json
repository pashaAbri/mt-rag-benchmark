  "gold_answer": "Air-to-air military aviation photography,  requires additional skills , as the photo and target aircraft often fly at velocities of over Mach 1, while under moderate to high G . On the other hand, in ground-to-air settings a long focus photographic lens is necessary due to the greater distance between the photographer and the target aircraft. Thus is it hard to say if one is more difficult than other conclusively.",

The subject aircraft is photographed while both aircraft are in flight . This allows the photographer to position the subject in specific locations and angles to get the most desirable shot . Some things that must be considered to achieve best results are lighting and background . Proper lighting is achieved through correct placement of the aircraft relative to the sun , and is accomplished flying only at certain times of the day and / or by flying at a heading that lines the sun up on the subject aircraft properly . The background can highlight or distract from the subject and must be carefully considered when taking shots . Air - to - air photography uses include commercial use and advertising . Remote",
