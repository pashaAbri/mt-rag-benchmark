The Indian population rose to 300 million by 1920 and the population of undivided India in 1947 was approx 390 million .  The first post-colonial census , conducted in 1951 , counted 361.1 million people after partition in India. According to the 1951 Census of India , 2 % of India 's population were refugees ( 1.3 % from West Pakistan and 0.7 % from East Pakistan ) . Delhi received the largest number of refugees for a single city -- the population of Delhi grew rapidly in 1947 from under 1 million ( 917,939 ) to a little less than 2 million ( 1,744,072 ) during the period 1941 -- 1951 ",

The human sex ratio , according to the 2011 census , is 940 females per 1,000 males . The median age was 27.6 as of 2016 . The first post-colonial census , conducted in 1951 , counted 361.1 million people . Medical advances made in the last 50 years as well as increased agricultural productivity brought about by the `` Green Revolution '' have caused India 's population to grow rapidly . India continues to face several public health - related challenges .",

The refugees were housed in various historical and military locations such as the Purana Qila , Red Fort , and military barracks in Kingsway Camp ( around the present Delhi University ) . The latter became the site of one of the largest refugee camps in northern India with more than 35,000 refugees at any given time besides Kurukshetra camp near Panipat . The camp sites were later converted into permanent housing through extensive building projects undertaken by the Government of India from 1948 onwards . A number of housing colonies in Delhi came up around this period like Lajpat Nagar , Rajinder Nagar , Nizamuddin East , Punjabi Bagh , Rehgar Pura , Jangpura and Kingsway Camp . A number of schemes such as the provision of education , employment opportunities , and easy loans to start businesses were provided for the refugees at the all - India level .",

'' Once the lines were established , about 14.5 million people crossed the borders to what they hoped was the relative safety of religious majority . The 1951 Census of Pakistan identified the number of displaced persons in Pakistan at 7,226,600 , presumably all Muslims who had entered Pakistan from India . Similarly , the 1951 Census of India enumerated 7,295,870 displaced persons , apparently all Hindus and Sikhs who had moved to India from Pakistan immediately after the Partition . The two numbers add up to 14.5 million . Since both censuses were held about 3.6 years after the Partition , the enumeration included net population increase after the mass migration .",

As a result of peace and improved sanitation and health , the Indian population rose from perhaps 100 million in 1700 to 300 million by 1920 . While encouraging agricultural productivity , the British also provided economic incentives to have more children to help in the fields . Although a similar population increase occurred in Europe at the same time , the growing numbers could be absorbed by industrialization or emigration to the Americas and Australia . India enjoyed neither an industrial revolution nor an increase in food growing . Moreover , Indian landlords had a stake in the cash crop system and discouraged innovation . As a result , population numbers far outstripped the amount of available food and land , creating dire poverty and widespread hunger . '' -- - Craig A.
