  "input": "what is the most popular Shakespearean play in China?",
  "gold_answer": "In the years of tentative political and economic liberalization after the death of Mao in 1976 , Shakespeare became popular in China. Of all his plays , the most popular in China in the late 1970s and 1980s was Macbeth, as Chinese audiences saw in a play first performed in England in 1606 and set in 11th century Scotland a parallel with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s. The story of a national hero becoming a tyrant complete with a power-hungry wife was seen as a parallel with Mao Zedong and his wife , Jiang Qing . The critic Zhao Xun wrote \"Macbeth is the fifth Shakespearean play produced on the Chinese stage after the smashing of the Gang of Four. This play of conspiracy has always been performed at critical moments in the history of our nation.'' ",

Hamlet appears to have been his fourth most popular play at that time, surpassed only by Henry IV Part 1 , Richard III and Pericles. Romeo and Juliet is also known to have been extremely popular then, so much so that it was performed outside of England as well, in N\u00f6rdlingen in 1604.\n|user|: How many film adaptations of Hamlet are there?\n|assistant|: I do not have specific information about the exact number of film adaptations of Hamlet. However, the earliest screen success recorded for Hamlet was Sara Bernhardt's 5-minute film of the fencing scene, which was produced in 1900. The film was an early attempt at combining sound and film , music and words were recorded on phonograph records , to be played along with the film . Seven silent versions were released from 1907-1921. Laurence Olivier adapted, produced, directed and starred in his screen version in 1948. Tony Richardson directed  the first Hamlet film in color in 1969. Franco A version by Franco Zeffirelli, with Mel Gibson and Glenn Close came out in 1990, and Kenneth Branagh's version was released in 1996. A version set in contemporary Manhattan and starring Ethan Hawke dates back to 2000. There have also been several films that transposed the general storyline of Hamlet or elements thereof to other settings . For example , the 2014 Bollywood film Haider is an adaptation set in Kashmir . There have also been many films which included performances of scenes from Hamlet as a play - within - a-film .\n|user|: What about Romeo and Juliet?\n|assistant|: Just like Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet has been adapted multiple times for the small and large screens. It may be the most filmed play of all time, with notable theatrical releases such as George Cukor's 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 version, and Baz Luhrmann's 1996 MTV-inspired Romeo + Juliet. The play was first filmed in the silent era by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, although his film is now lost.

In 1960 , Peter Ustinov 's cold - war stage parody , Romanoff and Juliet was filmed. film A popular film of a musical theatre adaptation, West Side Story was made in 1961 . This version updated the setting to mid-20th - century New York City and the warring families to ethnic gangs. Other musical adaptations include Terrence Mann 's 1999 rock musical William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet , co-written with Jerome Korman , G\u00e9rard Presgurvic 's 2001 Rom\u00e9o et Juliette , de la Haine \u00e0 l'Amour and Riccardo Cocciante 's 2007 Giulietta & Romeo . In 2013 , Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram - Leela , a contemporary version of the play. which was a commercial and critical success. \n|user|: Hamnet\n|assistant|: Hamnet is the name of William Shakespeare's only son. He was born in 1585 and died in 1596 at the age of 11. The death of Hamnet had a profound impact on Shakespeare, and some literary scholars believe that it may have influenced his work, particularly his play \"Hamlet,\" which was written around the same time. However, this connection is still a subject of debate, most scholars rejecting the idea that the play is in any way connected to Shakespeare's son.\n|user|: What was Shakespeare's most popular historical play?\n|assistant|: Based on the provided document, Shakespeare's most popular historical play was Henry IV Part 1.\n|user|: A horse , a horse , my kingdom for a horse !\n|assistant|: The famous line \"A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse!\" is from Shakespeare's play Richard III. It is spoken by the character Richard, Duke of Gloucester, when he is unhorsed in the Battle of Bosworth Field, and realizes that he would give up his kingdom for a horse to continue fighting.\n|user|: Is Richard III historically accurate?\n|assistant|: Shakespeare's Richard III is a dramatic interpretation of history rather than a strict historical account. While the play is based on the true story of King Richard III of England, it contains numerous historical inaccuracies which can be attributed partly to Shakespeare 's sources, such as Holinshed 's Chronicles, and there is no doubt that Shakespeare drew heavily on Sir Thomas More 's account of Richard III as a criminal and tyrant as inspiration for his own rendering. Shakespeare and the Tudor chroniclers who influenced him, were obliged to portray the downfall of the Plantagenet House of York and the victory of the House of Tudor as good conquering evil. This is usually attributed to bias as a result of a new regime being in place. \n|user|: what is the most popular Shakespearean play in China?"

      "text": "Romeo and Juliet\nRomeo and Juliet ranks with Hamlet as one of Shakespeare 's most performed plays . Its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories . Even in Shakespeare 's lifetime , it was extremely popular . Scholar Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare 's plays , in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London 's dominant playwright . The date of the first performance is unknown . The First Quarto , printed in 1597 , says that `` it hath been often ( and with great applause ) plaid publiquely '' , setting the first performance before that date . The Lord Chamberlain 's Men were certainly the first to perform it . Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare , the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors , Will Kemp , instead of Peter , in a line in Act Five . Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo , being the company 's actor , and Master Robert Goffe ( a boy ) the first Juliet . The premiere is likely to have been at `` The Theatre '' , with other early productions at `` The Curtain '' . Romeo and Juliet is one of the first Shakespearean plays to have been performed outside England : a shortened and simplified version was performed in N\u00f6rdlingen in 1604 .",
