  "input": "What can you say about American Football? Is i talso considered a popular sport as soccer?",
  "gold_answer": "American Football is the most popular spectator sport in the United States by several measures. It has a large following and attracts significant television audiences.  The National Football League ( NFL ) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world , and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally.  American Football is also played and viewed in other countries. For instance, American football has a long history in Mexico , which was introduced to the sport in 1896 . It  was the second-most popular sport in Mexico in the 1950s , with the game being particularly popular in colleges . The Los Angeles Times notes that the NFL claims over 16 million fans in Mexico , which places the country third behind the US and Canada. The game has a significant following in Canada according to a 2013 poll , 21 % of respondents said they followed the NFL very closely '' or fairly closely '' , making it the third-most followed league behind the National Hockey League ( NHL ) and Canadian Football League ( CFL ). The sport is played in European countries as well, such as Switzerland , which has American football clubs in every major city , and Germany . But in those countries American football has not yet reached the same level of popularity it has in North America. ",

      "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nMajor League Soccer 's first all - star game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996 . The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .",

The format of the game has evolved over the years. Initially, it featured the Eastern Conference playing against the Western Conference. However, since 2005, MLS has been inviting a professional club from abroad to participate. The opponents are usually from Europe, specifically England's Premier League, due to the scheduling coincidence of the MLS midseason with the pre-seasons of most European leagues. Players earn roster spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner. The game is considered a pre-season friendly from a European perspective.              \n|user|: When did the MSL All-Star game start?\n|assistant|: The first MLS All-Star Game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996.

A good height is also considered advantageous somewhat as can determine the position that they play as for forwards who aim to score with their heads  ; however , people of all heights have an equal opportunity to excel professionally at the sport .A study of the greatest male players in history showed that the distribution of heights approximated the average man.\n|user|: Are Soccer still considered the most watched sports around the world?\n|assistant|: Yes, soccer, also known as football in many parts of the world, is still considered the most popular and most-watched sport globally played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations , and has the highest television audience in sport , making it  definitely the most popular in the world.

      "text": "American football\nAmerican football , referred to as football in the United States and Canada and also known as gridiron , is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular field with goalposts at each end . The offense , which is the team controlling the oval - shaped football , attempts to advance down the field by running with or passing the ball , while the defense , which is the team without control of the ball , aims to stop the offense 's advance and aims to take control of the ball for themselves . The offense must advance at least ten yards in four downs , or plays , and otherwise they turn over the football to the defense ; if the offense succeeds in advancing ten yards or more , they are given a new set of four downs . Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team 's end zone for a touchdown or kicking the ball through the opponent 's goalposts for a field goal . The team with the most points at the end of a game wins .",

      "text": "American football\nWhat is considered to be the first American football game was played on November 6 , 1869 between Rutgers and Princeton , two college teams . The game was played between two teams of 25 players each and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried . It could , however , be kicked or batted with the feet , hands , head or sides , with the ultimate goal being to advance it into the opponent 's goal . Rutgers won the game 6 goals to 4 . Collegiate play continued for several years in which matches were played using the rules of the host school . Representatives of Yale , Columbia , Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19 , 1873 to create a standard set of rules for all schools to adhere to . Teams were set at 20 players each , and fields of 400 by 250 feet ( 122 m \u00d7 76 m ) were specified . Harvard abstained from the conference , as they favored a rugby - style game that allowed running with the ball .",
