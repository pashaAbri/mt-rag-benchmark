        "text": "Berlin Wall\nIn 1989 a series of revolutions in nearby Eastern Bloc countries -- Poland and Hungary in particular -- caused a chain reaction in East Germany that ultimately resulted in the demise of the Wall . After several weeks of civil unrest , the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin . Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the Wall , joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere . Over the next few weeks , euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the Wall ; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of what was left . The `` fall of the Berlin Wall '' paved the way for German reunification , which formally took place on 3 October 1990 .",

The guards often let fugitives bleed to death in the middle of this ground , as in the most notorious failed attempt , that of Peter Fechter ( aged 18 ) . He was shot and bled to death , in full view of the Western media , on 17 August 1962 . Fechter 's death created negative publicity worldwide that led the leaders of East Berlin to place more restrictions on shooting in public places , and provide medical care for possible `` would - be escapers '' . The last person to be shot and killed while trying to cross the border was Chris Gueffroy on 6 February 1989 , while the final person to die in an escape attempt was Winfried Freudenberg who was killed when his homemade natural gas - filled balloon crashed on 8 March 1989 .",
