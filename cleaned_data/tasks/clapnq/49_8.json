  "input": "Is it similar to rugby?",
  "gold_answer": "Yes, both sports originated from the older game of rugby football in the 19th century. British colonists and the British military introduced football to North America, where it became popular in American and Canadian universities and prep schools. At that time, association football and rugby football were not as distinct as they are now, and teams would negotiate the rules before each game. It's possible to compare American football and rugby league because they share origins and similar game concepts. Along with Canadian football, the rugby league is the sport most similar to American football. Both sports involve a limited number of downs or tackles, and scoring touchdowns or tries takes precedence over goal-kicking.",
