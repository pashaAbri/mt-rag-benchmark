Fallon incorporated the Internet much more than other talk shows . Between Fallon 's own musical sensibilities and the recruitment of his house band , hip - hop collective The Roots , his incarnation of Late Night `` evolved into the most deeply musical of TV 's musical - comedy variety programs '' , with sketches in which he parodies Neil Young and Bruce Springsteen going viral online . Coincidentally , it was during the Tonight Show debacle that Fallon 's show found its footing . The show , according to Fallon 's former SNL castmate Tina Fey , established itself as `` an uncommonly warm , welcoming show . '' In 2010 , New York complimented Fallon 's `` good humor '' and noted his improvement : `` In the relative safety of his 12 : 35 a.m. time slot , Fallon has been cultivating a distinct , and refreshing , strain of humor : the comedy of unabashed celebration . '' `` In our heads , we 've been doing The Tonight Show ( ... ) We 're just on at a later hour , '' Fallon said .",
