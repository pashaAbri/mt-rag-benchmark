Also in  scientific literature , a primary source is the original publication of a scientist 's new data , results and theories . In the history of ideas or intellectual history , the main primary sources are books , essays and letters written by intellectuals .Literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another are also considered primary source.  Primary sources can be uses in many fields not just on literature field. Another examples of its use is in humanities.  A primary source could be  also defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time .",

They serve as original sources of information about the topic. Examples of primary sources in history include novels or plays, photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings, buildings, archaeological artifacts, oral reports, and interviews. Written sources may be divided into three types: documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns, and eyewitness accounts; books, essays, and letters written by intellectuals; and religious texts and descriptions of religious ceremonies and rituals.\n|user|: archaeological discoveries and colonialists\n|assistant|: In fact archaeological discoveries helped to shaped the way European colonialists identified with the artifacts and the ancient people who made them . For instance, colonial Europe 's mission in Egypt was able to bring the glory and magnificence of ancient Egypt closer to Europe and incorporate it into knowledge of world history , putting that country  new spotlight . With the archaeological discoveries , ancient Egypt was adopted into the Western historical narrative and came to take on a significance that had up until that time been reserved for ancient Greek and Roman civilization . Also  , historians of the pre-Columbian period mainly interpreted the records of the European conquerors and the accounts of early European travelers and antiquaries .\n|user|: Celts\n|assistant|:  Archaeological discoveries suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia but scholars assumed that the original land of the Celts was west of the Rhine , more precisely in Gaul , because it was where Greek and Roman ancient sources , namely Caesar , located the Celts . This view was challenged by the 19th - century historian Marie Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville who placed the land of origin of the Celts east of the Rhine . Jubainville based his arguments on a phrase of Herodotus ' that placed the Celts at the source of the Danube , and argued that Herodotus had meant to place the Celtic homeland in southern Germany . The finding of the prehistoric cemetery of Hallstat in 1846 by Johan Ramsauer and the finding of the archaeological site of La T\u00e8ne by Hansli Kopp in 1857 drew attention to this area .Archaeologists have also discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany . As the territory held by the Celts contained tin , lead , iron , silver and gold , they were metalworkers that created weapons and jewellery for international trade , particularly with the Romans .\n|user|: Talking about the Celts, what is the importance of them in history?\n|assistant|: Besides those areas of trade  that was mentioned before, the Celts were were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon , through the cultures of Hallstatt and La T\u00e8ne . The Celtic languages were also important to form  a branch of the larger Indo - European family . By the time speakers of Celtic languages entered history around 400 BC , they were already split into several language groups , and spread over much of Western continental Europe , the Iberian Peninsula , Ireland and Britain . Additionally, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship , although this may only have been a particular late phase of organization in Celtic societies .
