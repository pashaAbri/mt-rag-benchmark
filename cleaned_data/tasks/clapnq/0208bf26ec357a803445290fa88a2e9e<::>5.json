  "input": "I'm told guinea pigs are raised for human consumption. Is that true?",
  "gold_answer": "Yes, that is true. They were originally domesticated for their meat by tribes in the Andes, where they are a culinary staple, as early as 5000 BC  and are raised for human consumption ini Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia particularly in the Andes Mountain Highlands. They are a traditional source of protein in these regions and are often featured in local cuisine. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large - scale municipal fairs ,",

      "text": "Guinea pig\nC. porcellus is not found naturally in the wild ; it is likely descended from closely related species of cavies , such as C. aperea , C. fulgida , and C. tschudii , which are still commonly found in various regions of South America . Studies from 2007 -- 2010 applied molecular markers and studied the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals , thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be Cavia tschudii . Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ) , when it is harder for predators to spot them .",

      "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig 's natural diet is grass ; their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter and grow continuously throughout their life . Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .",

      "text": "Guinea pig\nGuinea pigs ( called cuy , cuye , or cur\u00ed ) were originally domesticated for their meat in the Andes . Traditionally , the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands , but since the 1960s , it has become more socially acceptable for consumption by all people . It continues to be a major part of the diet in Peru and Bolivia , particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands ; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador ( mainly in the Sierra ) and Colombia . Because guinea pigs require much less room than traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly , they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals , such as pigs and cattle ; moreover , they can be raised in an urban environment . Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income , and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large - scale municipal fairs . Guinea pig meat is high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol , and is described as being similar to rabbit and the dark meat of chicken . The animal may be served fried ( chactado or frito ) , broiled ( asado ) , or roasted ( al horno ) , and in urban restaurants may also be served in a casserole or a fricassee . Ecuadorians commonly consume sopa or locro de cuy , a soup dish . Pachamanca or huatia , a process similar to barbecueing , is also popular , and is usually served with corn beer ( chicha ) in traditional settings .",

      "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig was first domesticated as early as 5000 BC for food by tribes in the Andean region of South America ( the present - day southern part of Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , and Bolivia ) , some thousands of years after the domestication of the South American camelids . Statues dating from circa 500 BC to 500 AD that depict guinea pigs have been unearthed in archaeological digs in Peru and Ecuador . The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped animals and often depicted the guinea pig in their art . From about 1200 AD to the Spanish conquest in 1532 , selective breeding resulted in many varieties of domestic guinea pigs , which form the basis for some of the modern domestic breeds . They continue to be a food source in the region ; many households in the Andean highlands raise the animal , which subsists on the family 's vegetable scraps . Folklore traditions involving guinea pigs are numerous ; they are exchanged as gifts , used in customary social and religious ceremonies , and frequently referenced in spoken metaphors . They also play a role in traditional healing rituals by folk doctors , or curanderos , who use the animals to diagnose diseases such as jaundice , rheumatism , arthritis , and typhus . They are rubbed against the bodies of the sick , and are seen as a supernatural medium . Black guinea pigs are considered especially useful for diagnoses . The animal also may be cut open and its entrails examined to determine whether the cure was effective . These methods are widely accepted in many parts of the Andes , where Western medicine is either unavailable or distrusted .",
