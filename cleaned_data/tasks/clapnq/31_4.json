  "gold_answer": "The origin of HIV is still a matter of debate among scientists, but it is believed originated in sub-Saharan Africa (Southeast Cameroon) through exposure to infected blood and body fluids while butchering bushmeat during the 20th century , although  symptomatic infections were not reported until the 1980s. AIDS was at first considered a disease of gay men and drug addicts but then in Africa it took off among the general population . AIDS became a significant problem for the region , particularly in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire , Liberia , and Nigeria . The onset of the HIV epidemic in the region began in 1985 with reported cases in Benin and Nigeri , and in nearby countries, such as C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, in subsequent years .",

Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they can not cause the disease . The yellow fever virus vaccine , a live - attenuated strain called 17D , is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated . Antiviral",

During the outbreak from 1900 - 1904 in San Francisco is when authorities made permanent the Chinese Exclusion Act . This law was originally signed into existence by President Chester A. Arthur in 1882 . The Chinese Exclusion Act was supposed to last for ten years but was renewed in 1892 with the Geary Act and subsequently made permanent in 1902 during the outbreak of plague in Chinatown , San Francisco . The last major outbreak in the United States occurred in Los Angeles in 1924 , though the disease is still present in wild rodents , and can be passed to humans that come in contact with them . According to the World Health Organization , the pandemic was considered active until 1959 , when worldwide casualties dropped to 200 per year . In 1994 , a plague outbreak in five Indian states caused an estimated 700 infections ( including 52 deaths ) and triggered a large migration of Indians within India as they tried to avoid the plague .",

However , HIV - 1 was effectively absent from Europe until the late 1980s . Therefore , given the average age of roughly 1000 years for the CCR5 - \u039432 allele , it can be established that HIV - 1 did not exert selection pressure on the human population for long enough to achieve the current frequencies . Hence , other pathogens have been suggested agents of positive selection for CCR5 \u039432 . The first major one being bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) , and later , smallpox ( Variola major ) . Other data suggest that the allele frequency resulted as a negative selection pressure as a result of pathogens that became more widespread during Roman expansion . The idea that negative selection played a role in its low frequency is also supported by experiments using knockout mice and Influenza A , which demonstrated that the presence of the CCR5 receptor is important for efficient response to a pathogen .",

The HIV - 1 epidemic is therefore far too young to be the source of positive selection that drove the frequency of CCR5 \u039432 from zero to 10 % in 2000 years . In 1998 , Stephens et al. suggested that bubonic plague ( Yersinia pestis ) had exerted positive selective pressure on CCR5 \u039432 . This hypothesis was based on the timing and severity of the Black Death pandemic , which killed 30 % of the European population of all ages between 1346 and 1352 . After the Black Death , there were less severe , intermittent , epidemics . Individual cities experienced high mortality , but overall mortality in Europe was only a few percent . In 1655 - 1656 a second pandemic called the `` Great Plague '' killed 15 - 20 % of Europe 's population . Importantly , the plague epidemics were intermittent . Bubonic plague is a zoonotic disease , primarily infecting rodents and spread by fleas and only occasionally infecting humans . Human - to - human infection of bubonic plague does not occur , though it can occur in pneumonic plague , which infects the lungs . Only when the density of rodents is low are infected fleas forced to feed on alternative hosts such as humans , and under these circumstances a human epidemic may occur . Based on population genetic models , Galvani and Slatkin ( 2003 ) argue that the intermittent nature of plague epidemics did not generate a sufficiently strong selective force to drive the allele frequency of CCR5 \u039432 to 10 % in Europe .",

This change in emphasis resulted in more funding , but was not effective in preventing a drastic rise in HIV prevalence . The global response to HIV and AIDS has improved considerably in recent years . Funding comes from many sources , the largest of which are the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria and the President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief .",

In 2007 , in response to international pressure , the government made efforts to fight AIDS . After the 2009 General Elections , President Jacob Zuma appointed Dr Aaron Motsoaledi as the new minister and committed his government to increasing funding for and widening the scope of AIDS treatment .",
