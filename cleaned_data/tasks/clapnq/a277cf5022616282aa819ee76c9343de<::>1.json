  "gold_answer": "The United States demanded a complete halt to trade with Japan because it wanted to bring the Japanese war effort to a stop, particularly their war in China. The US recognized Chiang Kai-Shek's Nationalist Government as the legitimate government of China. The United States sought to bring the Japanese war effort to a halt by imposing an embargo on all trade between the United States and Japan. This was a response to Japan's dependence on the US for 80% of its petroleum. The US aimed to create an economic and military crisis for Japan, hoping that this would force Japan to withdraw its troops from China and Indochina.",
