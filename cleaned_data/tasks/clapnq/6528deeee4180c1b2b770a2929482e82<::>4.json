      "text": "Poverty in India\nThese colonial policies moved unemployed artisans into farming , and transformed India as a region increasingly abundant in land , unskilled labour and low productivity , and scarce in skilled labour , capital and knowledge . On an inflation adjusted 1973 Rupee basis , the average income of Indian agrarian labourer was Rs. 7.20 per year in 1885 , against an inflation adjusted poverty line of Rs. 23.90 per year . Thus , not only was the average income below poverty line , the intensity of poverty was severe . The intensity of poverty increased from 1885 to 1921 , then began a reversal . However , the absolute poverty rates continued to be very high through the 1930s . The colonial policies on taxation and its recognition of land ownership claims of zamindars and mansabdars , or Mughal era nobility , made a minority of families wealthy , while it weakened the ability of poorer peasants to command land and credit . The resulting rising landlessness and stagnant real wages intensified poverty .",
