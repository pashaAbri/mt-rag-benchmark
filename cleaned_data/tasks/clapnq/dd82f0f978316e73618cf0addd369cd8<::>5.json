It is important that they are lean and muscular with a reasonably high level of capacity in all areas of physical performance. Height is considered advantageous for forwards who aim to score with their heads, and many of the world 's best forwards and midfielders are taller than average.",

        "text": "Major League Soccer All-Star Game\nMajor League Soccer 's first all - star game was played at Giants Stadium in the summer of 1996 . The game , using the traditional East -- West format with players handpicked by the coaching staffs , was the first game of a doubleheader with the Brazilian national team defeating a team of FIFA World All - Stars . The matchup between divisions would only be used for six seasons as MLS tried experimenting with different formats . The 1998 All - Star Game placed a team of American MLS players against MLS players from abroad . The 2002 game , the first to use a league - wide all - star team , is the only game to feature a national team opponent . Since then ( except in 2004 ) , every opponent has been a professional club invited by the league . The MLS All - Stars won their first six games before falling to Everton in penalties in 2009 . All games since 2005 have been against teams from Europe , the majority of which have been from England 's Premier League . This is a feasible format because unlike MLS ( which runs a spring - summer - fall schedule ) the major European leagues all run a fall - winter - spring schedule , meaning the middle of the MLS season coincides with the pre-seasons of most European leagues . From a European perspective , the match is considered to be a pre-season friendly against an MLS XI .",

The format of the game has evolved over the years. Initially, it featured the Eastern Conference playing against the Western Conference. However, since 2005, MLS has been inviting a professional club from abroad to participate. The opponents are usually from Europe, specifically England's Premier League, due to the scheduling coincidence of the MLS midseason with the pre-seasons of most European leagues. Players earn roster spots through a combination of fan voting and selections by the appointed manager and league commissioner.

        "text": "Height in sports\nIn association football , or soccer , a player 's height may somewhat determine the position that they play ; however , people of all heights have an equal opportunity to excel professionally at the sport . Goalkeepers , centre backs and `` target '' heading forwards tend to be taller , while players in wide and attacking positions tend to be shorter . A study of the greatest male players in history showed that the distribution of heights approximated the average man and , when also looking at the typical weight distribution , an estimated 95 % of the world 's population would fall into the body type distribution of great footballers . A sample of reasonably select players from ages 11 -- 18 in the United States tended to approximate the height distribution of the population . However , there is an overwhelming tendency for the 11-most picked players in a squad to be shorter than their teammates , which could suggest a bias in the scouting system .",
