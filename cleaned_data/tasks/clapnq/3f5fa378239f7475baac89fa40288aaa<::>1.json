    "text": "The different shapes of the Moon, also known as lunar phases, are determined by the amount of sunlight that is illuminating the portion of the Moon visible from Earth. This changes as the Moon orbits the Earth and the relative positions of the Moon, Earth, and Sun shift. When the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned, with the Sun and Moon on opposite sides of the Earth, we see a full moon. When the Moon is positioned between the Earth and the Sun, we see a new moon. The crescent and gibbous shapes occur during the intervals between these principal phases, when only a portion of the Moon's surface is illuminated. The specific shape at any given time depends on the Moon's position in its orbit. When a sphere is illuminated on one hemisphere and viewed from a different angle , the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two - dimensional shape defined by the intersection of an ellipse and circle ( where the major axis of the ellipse coincides with a diameter of the circle ) . If the half - ellipse is convex with respect to the half - circle , then the shape will be gibbous ( bulging outwards ) whereas if the half - ellipse is concave with respect to the half - circle , then the shape will be a crescent .",

        "text": "Lunar phase\nThe lunar phase or phase of the moon is the shape of the illuminated ( sunlit ) portion of the Moon as seen by an observer on Earth . The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth , according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth . The Moon 's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth 's gravity , therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth . This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit . Therefore , the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100 % ( full moon ) to 0 % ( new moon ) . The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres . Each of the four `` intermediate '' lunar phases ( see below ) is roughly seven days ( ~ 7.4 days ) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon 's orbit . Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker , all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight , followed by 14.77 days of `` night '' . ( The side of the Moon facing away from the Earth is sometimes called the `` dark side of the Moon '' , although that is a misnomer . )",

        "text": "Lunar phase\nIn Western culture , the four principal lunar phases are new moon , first quarter , full moon , and third quarter ( also known as last quarter ) . These are the instances when the Moon 's apparent geocentric celestial longitude minus the Sun 's apparent geocentric celestial longitude is 0 \u00b0 , 90 \u00b0 , 180 \u00b0 and 270 \u00b0 , respectively . Each of these phases occur at slightly different times when viewed from different points on the Earth . During the intervals between principal phases , the Moon appears either crescent - shaped or gibbous . These shapes , and the periods of time when the Moon shows them , are called the intermediate phases . They last , on average , one - quarter of a synodic month , roughly 7.38 days , but their durations vary slightly because the Moon 's orbit is slightly elliptical , and thus its speed in orbit is not constant . The descriptor waxing is used for an intermediate phase when the Moon 's apparent size is increasing , from new moon toward full moon , and waning when the size is decreasing .",

As the moon waxes ( the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing ) , the lunar phases progress through new moon , crescent moon , first - quarter moon , gibbous moon , and full moon . The moon is then said to wane as it passes through the gibbous moon , third - quarter moon , crescent moon and back to new moon . The terms `` old moon '' and `` new moon '' are not interchangeable . The `` old moon '' is a waning sliver ( which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye ) until the moment it aligns with the sun and begins to wax , at which point it becomes new again . Half moon is often used to mean the first - and third - quarter moons , while the term ' quarter ' refers to the extent of the moon 's cycle around the Earth , not its shape .",
