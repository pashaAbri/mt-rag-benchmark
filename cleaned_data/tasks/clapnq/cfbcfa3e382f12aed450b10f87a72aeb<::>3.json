      "text": "Guinea pig\nBecause the guinea pig has a stout , compact body , it more easily tolerates excessive cold than excessive heat . Its normal body temperature is 101 -- 104 \u00b0 F ( 38 -- 40 \u00b0 C ) , so its ideal ambient air temperature range is similar to a human 's , about 65 -- 75 \u00b0 F ( 18 -- 24 \u00b0 C ) . Consistent ambient temperatures in excess of 90 \u00b0 F ( 32 \u00b0 C ) have been linked to hyperthermia and death , especially among pregnant sows . Guinea pigs are not well suited to environments that feature wind or frequent drafts , and respond poorly to extremes of humidity outside of the range of 30 -- 70 % .",
