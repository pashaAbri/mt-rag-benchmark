  "gold_answer": "It seems like you might be referring to the concept of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\" This was a concept put forward by the Japanese government before and during World War II. It promoted the idea of a bloc of Asian nations led by the Empire of Japan, free from Western powers and to create a self-sufficient economic sphere.  It included Manchuria , Inner Mongolia , large parts of China , Malaysia , French Indochina , Dutch East Indies , The Philippines , Burma , a small part of India , and various Pacific Islands in the central Pacific .  This idea was used to justify Japanese expansionism and aggression in Asia during World War II.",
