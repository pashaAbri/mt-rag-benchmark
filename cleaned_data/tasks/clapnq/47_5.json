  "gold_answer": "E. E. Cummings (October 14, 1894 -- September 3, 1962) was an American poet, painter, essayist, author, and playwright. Cummings wrote approximately 2900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays. Many of his poems are satirical and address social issues, but they also have a strong bias towards romanticism, celebrating love, sex, and the season of rebirth. His first published work was a collection of poems titled Tulips and Chimneys (1923), which introduced the public to his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation. In addition to his poetry, Cummings also wrote children's books and novels, showcasing his versatility as a writer. ",
