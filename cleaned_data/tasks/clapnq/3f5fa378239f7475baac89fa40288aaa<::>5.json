This changes as the Moon orbits the Earth and the relative positions of the Moon, Earth, and Sun shift. When the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned, with the Sun and Moon on opposite sides of the Earth, we see a full moon. When the Moon is positioned between the Earth and the Sun, we see a new moon. The crescent and gibbous shapes occur during the intervals between these principal phases, when only a portion of the Moon's surface is illuminated. The specific shape at any given time depends on the Moon's position in its orbit. When a sphere is illuminated on one hemisphere and viewed from a different angle , the portion of the illuminated area that is visible will have a two - dimensional shape defined by the intersection of an ellipse and circle ( where the major axis of the ellipse coincides with a diameter of the circle ) . If the half - ellipse is convex with respect to the half - circle , then the shape will be gibbous ( bulging outwards ) whereas if the half - ellipse is concave with respect to the half - circle , then the shape will be a crescent .\n|user|: What is the distance between the moon and earth?\n|assistant|: I do not have specific information on the current distance between the Moon and Earth. However, it's worth noting that the average distance from the Moon to the Earth is about 238,855 miles or 384,400 kilometers. But this distance varies throughout the Moon's orbit, ranging from about 225,623 miles or 363,104 kilometers at its closest, to about 252,088 miles or 405,696 kilometers at its farthest. Lunar distance (astronomy) Astronomers O'Keefe and Anderson calculated the lunar distance by observing 4 occultations from 9 locations in 1952 . They calculated a mean distance of 7008384407600000000 \u2660 384 407. 6 \u00b1 4.7 km , however the value was refined by in 1962 by Irene Fischer , who incorporated updated geodetic data to produce a value of 7008384403700000000 \u2660 384 403. 7 \u00b1 2 km .\n|user|: How old is the moon?\n|assistant|: The age of the Moon is not explicitly stated in the provided documents. However, it's worth noting that scientific estimates suggest the Moon is approximately 4.6 billion years old, which is thought to be close to the age of the Earth.\n|user|: What was the longest mission to the moon?\n|assistant|: The provided documents do not contain specific information about the longest mission to the Moon. However, Apollo 17, which lasted for 12 days, 13 hours, and 51 minutes, is often cited as the longest crewed mission to the Moon.\n|user|: what makes monkeys suitable for space travel?"

As the moon waxes ( the amount of illuminated surface as seen from Earth is increasing ) , the lunar phases progress through new moon , crescent moon , first - quarter moon , gibbous moon , and full moon . The moon is then said to wane as it passes through the gibbous moon , third - quarter moon , crescent moon and back to new moon . The terms `` old moon '' and `` new moon '' are not interchangeable . The `` old moon '' is a waning sliver ( which eventually becomes undetectable to the naked eye ) until the moment it aligns with the sun and begins to wax , at which point it becomes new again . Half moon is often used to mean the first - and third - quarter moons , while the term ' quarter ' refers to the extent of the moon 's cycle around the Earth , not its shape .",

        "text": "Lunar phase\nThe lunar phase or phase of the moon is the shape of the illuminated ( sunlit ) portion of the Moon as seen by an observer on Earth . The lunar phases change cyclically as the Moon orbits the Earth , according to the changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth . The Moon 's rotation is tidally locked by the Earth 's gravity , therefore the same lunar surface always faces Earth . This face is variously sunlit depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit . Therefore , the portion of this hemisphere that is visible to an observer on Earth can vary from about 100 % ( full moon ) to 0 % ( new moon ) . The lunar terminator is the boundary between the illuminated and darkened hemispheres . Each of the four `` intermediate '' lunar phases ( see below ) is roughly seven days ( ~ 7.4 days ) but this varies slightly due to the elliptical shape of the Moon 's orbit . Aside from some craters near the lunar poles such as Shoemaker , all parts of the Moon see around 14.77 days of sunlight , followed by 14.77 days of `` night '' . ( The side of the Moon facing away from the Earth is sometimes called the `` dark side of the Moon '' , although that is a misnomer . )",
