      "text": "Partition of India\nThe Muslim League conducted its own investigation into the conditions of Muslims under Congress - governed provinces . The findings of such investigations increased fear among the Muslim masses of future Hindu domination . The view that Muslims would be unfairly treated in an independent India dominated by the Congress was now a part of the public discourse of Muslims . With the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , the viceroy , Lord Linlithgow , declared war on India 's behalf without consulting Indian leaders , leading the Congress provincial ministries to resign in protest . The Muslim League , which functioned under state patronage , in contrast , organized `` Deliverance Day '' , celebrations ( from Congress dominance ) and supported Britain in the war effort . When Linlithgow , met with nationalist leaders , he gave the same status to Jinnah as he did to Gandhi , and a month later described the Congress as a `` Hindu organization . ''",
