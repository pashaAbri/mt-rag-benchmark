  "gold_answer": "The treatment for sickle cell disease may include infection prevention with vaccination and antibiotics, high fluid intake, folic acid supplementation, pain medication, blood transfusion, and the medication hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea). A small percentage of people can be cured by a transplant of bone marrow cells. When treating avascular necrosis of the bone in people with sickle cell disease, the aim of treatment is to reduce or stop the pain and maintain joint mobility. Current treatment options are to rest the joint, physical therapy, pain relief medicine, joint replacement surgery, or bone grafting. High quality randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the most effective treatment option and determine if a combination of physical therapy and surgery are more effective than physical therapy alone.",

      "text": "Bone marrow\nBone marrow is a semi-solid tissue which may be found within the spongy or cancellous portions of bones . In birds and mammals , bone marrow is the primary site of new blood cell production or hematopoiesis . It is composed of hematopoietic cells , marrow adipose tissue , and supportive stromal cells . On average , bone marrow constitutes 4 % of the total body mass of humans ; in an adult having 65 kilograms of mass ( 143 lb ) , bone marrow typically accounts for approximately 2.6 kilograms ( 5.7 lb ) . Human marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day , which join the systemic circulation via permeable vasculature sinusoids within the medullary cavity . All types of hematopoietic cells , including both myeloid and lymphoid lineages , are created in bone marrow ; however , lymphoid cells must migrate to other lymphoid organs ( e.g. thymus ) in order to complete maturation .",

Human marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, which join the systemic circulation via permeable vasculature sinusoids within the medullary cavity. The main functional component of bone marrow includes the progenitor cells which are destined to mature into blood and lymphoid cells. These include white blood cells (leukocytes), red blood cells (erythrocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). In humans, the red marrow of some bones is an important site for blood cell production, approximately 2.6 million red blood cells per second in order to replace existing cells that have been destroyed by the liver. \n|user|: What happens if it does not work well?\n|assistant|: If bone marrow does not function properly, it can lead to a decrease in the production of blood cells and blood platelets. This can be caused by various factors such as aplastic anemia, malignancies like multiple myeloma, congenital defects , autoimmune diseases, infections like tuberculosis, leukemia, or exposure to radiation or chemotherapy. Symptoms of a malfunctioning bone marrow can include fatigue, increased risk of infection, and easy bruising or bleeding. In the case of sickle cell disease, the bone marrow's attempt to compensate for the destruction of red cells is not sufficient, leading to anemia.\n|user|: How is Sickle cell treated?"
