Christianity became more associated with the Empire , resulting in persecution for Christians living outside of the empire , as their rulers feared Christians would revolt in favor of the Emperor . In 385 , this new legal authority of the Church resulted in the first use of capital punishment being pronounced as a sentence upon a Christian ' heretic ' , namely Priscillian .",

In 313 , the struggles of the Early Church were lessened by the legalisation of Christianity by the Emperor Constantine I. In 380 , under Emperor Theodosius I , Catholicism became the state religion of the Roman Empire by the decree of the Emperor , which would persist until the fall of the Western Empire , and later , with the Eastern Roman Empire , until the Fall of Constantinople . During this time , the period of the Seven Ecumenical Councils , there were considered five primary sees ( jurisdictions within the Catholic Church ) according to Eusebius : Rome , Constantinople , Antioch , Jerusalem and Alexandria , known as the Pentarchy .",

    "original_text": "The Roman Empire, including its Byzantine continuation, never officially became Catholic. The Byzantine Empire adhered to Orthodox Christianity, which diverged from the Catholic Church in the Great Schism of 1054. Before this split, both Eastern and Western Christians were part of the same church, often referred to as the \"Undivided Church.\" However, differences in liturgy, theology, and language had been growing for centuries. The Byzantine Emperor supported the Orthodox Church, but the process of estrangement between Eastern and Western Christianity took several centuries, culminating in the formal schism in 1054."
