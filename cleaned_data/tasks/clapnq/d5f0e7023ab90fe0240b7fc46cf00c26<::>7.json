  "gold_answer": "The Amazon River is located in the America continent, also called the Americas, and is the largest river basin in the world, covering about 40% of South America with an area of approximately 7,050,000 square kilometers (2,722,020 sq mi). It flows from west to east, starting from Iquitos in Peru and continuing across Brazil to the Atlantic. The river runs mainly through Brazil and Peru and is part of the border between Colombia and Peru. With an average discharge of about 209,000 cubic meters per second (7,400,000 cu ft/s), the Amazon represents 20% of the global riverine discharge to the ocean, greater than the combined discharge of the following seven largest independent rivers.",
