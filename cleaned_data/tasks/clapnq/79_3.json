      "text": "Infertility\nThe main cause of male infertility is low semen quality . In men who have the necessary reproductive organs to procreate , infertility can be caused by low sperm count due to endocrine problems , drugs , radiation , or infection . There may be testicular malformations , hormone imbalance , or blockage of the man 's duct system . Although many of these can be treated through surgery or hormonal substitutions , some may be indefinite . Infertility associated with viable , but immotile sperm may be caused by primary ciliary dyskinesia . The sperm must provide the zygote with DNA , centrioles , and activation factor for the embryo to develop . A defect in any of these sperm structures may result in infertility that will not be detected by semen analysis . Antisperm antibodies cause immune infertility .",

      "text": "Infertility\nAnother major cause of infertility in women may be the inability to ovulate . Malformation of the eggs themselves may complicate conception . For example , polycystic ovarian syndrome is when the eggs only partially developed within the ovary and there is an excess of male hormones . Some women are infertile because their ovaries do not mature and release eggs . In this case synthetic FSH by injection or Clomid ( Clomiphene citrate ) via a pill can be given to stimulate follicles to mature in the ovaries .",

Infertility may be caused by blockage of the Fallopian tube due to malformations , infections such as chlamydia and / or scar tissue . For example , endometriosis can cause infertility with the growth of endometrial tissue in the Fallopian tubes and / or around the ovaries . Endometriosis is usually more common in women in their mid-twenties and older , especially when postponed childbirth has taken place .",

      "text": "Infertility\n`` Demographers tend to define infertility as childlessness in a population of women of reproductive age , '' whereas `` the epidemiological definition refers to `` trying for '' or `` time to '' a pregnancy , generally in a population of women exposed to '' a probability of conception . Currently , female fertility normally peaks at age 24 and diminishes after 30 , with pregnancy occurring rarely after age 50 . A female is most fertile within 24 hours of ovulation . Male fertility peaks usually at age 25 and declines after age 40 . The time needed to pass ( during which the couple tries to conceive ) for that couple to be diagnosed with infertility differs between different jurisdictions . Existing definitions of infertility lack uniformity , rendering comparisons in prevalence between countries or over time problematic . Therefore , data estimating the prevalence of infertility cited by various sources differs significantly . A couple that tries unsuccessfully to have a child after a certain period of time ( often a short period , but definitions vary ) is sometimes said to be subfertile , meaning less fertile than a typical couple . Both infertility and subfertility are defined as the inability to conceive after a certain period of time ( the length of which vary ) , so often the two terms overlap .",
