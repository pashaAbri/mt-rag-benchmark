  "input": "how was E. E. Cummings's life? Was E. E. Cummings's famous poem affected by something?",
  "gold_answer": "E. E. Cummings expressed a strong desire to become a poet, writing daily from the age of 8 to 22. He attended Harvard University, where he developed an interest in modern poetry while aiming for a dynamic use of language. Cummings's early work was influenced by notable modernists such as Gertrude Stein and Ezra Pound, as well as the imagist experiments of Amy Lowell. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to Dada and surrealism, which he incorporated into his poetry. Over time, his style evolved to rely more on symbolism and allegory, but he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem.",
