Tim Byron , writer for The Vine , `` ' Grenade ' is about the feeling of withdrawal '' . The critic added , `` Mars knows she is bad for him , that 's she 's preventing him from thinking straight , that he ca n't actually have her the way he wants , but he still nonetheless has crazy desires for that rush of romantic cocaine that he gets from her . '' As Mars commented in an interview to Blues & Soul : `` ' Grenade ' represents the OTHER side of love -- where you 're in love with a woman and you know for a fact that she does n't love you the way you love HER .

John Macdonald for Spin said `` Despite a couple pitch problems here and there , Mars proved to be nearly as good a performer as he is a songwriter '' . The song was also performed in a similar manner on the October 9 , 2010 episode of Saturday Night Live , as part of a segue from `` Nothin ' on You '' , the debut single was also performed . His performance was well received by critics . Billboard 's magazine critique Walter Frazier analysed the performance and commented `` Mars ' backing band ... dressed as a 1950s rockabilly group , while Mars resembled something of a modern - day Elvis , surely inspiring swoons for the `` SNL '' audience . '' The performance was also praised by Mawuse Ziegbe , MTV reviewer , who wrote : `` Mars peppered the performance with hip - swaying moves Elvis would be proud of and wrapped up the set in classic rock - star style with an enthusiastic jump in the air . '' On October 21 , 2010 , a soulful arrangement of the song was sung for a Billboard Tastemakers video session . On May 5 , 2011 Mars expressed his apprehension about performing the song because fans have been throwing dummy grenades on stage , some of which are metal and have posed a safety hazard .",
