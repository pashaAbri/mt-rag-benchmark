        "text": "Guinea pig\nThe scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus , with porcellus being Latin for `` little pig '' . Cavia is New Latin ; it is derived from cabiai , the animal 's name in the language of the Galibi tribes once native to French Guiana . Cabiai may be an adaptation of the Portuguese \u00e7avia ( now savia ) , which is itself derived from the Tupi word sauj\u00e1 , meaning rat . Guinea pigs are called quwi or jaca in Quechua and cuy or cuyo ( plural cuyes , cuyos ) in the Spanish of Ecuador , Peru , and Bolivia . Ironically , breeders tend to use the more formal `` cavy '' to describe the animal , while in scientific and laboratory contexts , it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial `` guinea pig '' .",

    "original_text": "The reason guinea pigs are called \"pigs\" is not entirely clear, but it could be due to their physical resemblance to pigs, such as their large heads, stout necks, rounded rumps, and the sounds they make. Additionally, guinea pigs can survive in small spaces for extended periods, making them easy to transport on ships, much like pigs in a pen. The name \"guinea pig\" is believed to have originated from their association with the country of Guinea and their use in medical experiments, even though they are not native to Guinea and are not true pigs."
