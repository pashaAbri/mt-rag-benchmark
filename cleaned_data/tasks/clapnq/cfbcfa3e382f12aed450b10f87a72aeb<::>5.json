      "text": "Guinea pig\nThe scientific name of the common species is Cavia porcellus , with porcellus being Latin for `` little pig '' . Cavia is New Latin ; it is derived from cabiai , the animal 's name in the language of the Galibi tribes once native to French Guiana . Cabiai may be an adaptation of the Portuguese \u00e7avia ( now savia ) , which is itself derived from the Tupi word sauj\u00e1 , meaning rat . Guinea pigs are called quwi or jaca in Quechua and cuy or cuyo ( plural cuyes , cuyos ) in the Spanish of Ecuador , Peru , and Bolivia . Ironically , breeders tend to use the more formal `` cavy '' to describe the animal , while in scientific and laboratory contexts , it is far more commonly referred to by the more colloquial `` guinea pig '' .",

They are built somewhat like pigs , with large heads relative to their bodies , stout necks , and rounded rumps with no tail of any consequence ; some of the sounds they emit are very similar to those made by pigs , and they also spend a large amount of time eating . They can survive for long periods in small quarters , like a ' pig pen ' , and were thus easily transported on ships to Europe .",
