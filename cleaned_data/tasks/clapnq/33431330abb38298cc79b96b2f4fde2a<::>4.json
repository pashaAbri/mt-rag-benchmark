  "gold_answer": "There are different theories about why Rome fell. One theory suggests that the victorious legions, who acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries during distant wars, first oppressed the republic's freedom and later violated the majesty of the purple. Emperors, concerned for their personal safety and public peace, resorted to corrupting the military discipline, ultimately leading to the military government's weakening and dissolution. This weakening was further exacerbated by the partial institutions of Constantine, ultimately leading to the Roman world being overrun by Barbarians. Historians are still analyzing the reasons for the loss of political control over a vast territory and the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire. Alexander Demandt listed 210 theories on why Rome fell, and new ideas continue to emerge. Gibbon's classic formulation of reasons for the Fall sparked ongoing controversy about the role of Christianity but also emphasized other causes of internal decline and external attacks on the Empire.",

      "text": "Fall of the Western Roman Empire\nThe story of its ruin is simple and obvious ; and , instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed , we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long . The victorious legions , who , in distant wars , acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries , first oppressed the freedom of the republic , and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple . The emperors , anxious for their personal safety and the public peace , were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy ; the vigour of the military government was relaxed , and finally dissolved , by the partial institutions of Constantine ; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians . --",
