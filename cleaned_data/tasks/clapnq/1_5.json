Proponents of expansion note the increased revenue that could be gained from an additional two playoff games . They also note that the 12 - team playoff system was implemented when the league only had 28 teams and six divisions ( of 4 to 5 teams each ) . The opposition to such a move notes that an expansion of the playoffs would `` water down '' the field by giving access to lower - caliber teams . Opponents to expansion further point to the NBA playoffs and the NHL playoffs where more than half of the teams qualify for the postseason , and there is often a decreased emphasis on regular season performance as a result .",

Since being a division winner is a guaranteed playoff berth , there have been many cases in which a team that wins a `` weak '' division either barely has a winning record or has a . 500 or losing record altogether ( such as the 2010 Seattle Seahawks ) . At the same time , since a division winner is seeded higher than the wild cards , non-division winners may end up playing a road game during Wild Card Weekend against a team with an inferior record , or may end up outright missing the playoffs . And going on the road during the first postseason round does not guarantee success : the first time that all four road teams won during Wild Card Weekend occurred during the 2015 -- 16 season .",
