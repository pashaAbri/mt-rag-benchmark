  "gold_answer": "Guinea pigs are one of the few animals which, like humans and other primates, cannot synthesize vitamin C but must obtain it from their diet. This makes them ideal for researching scurvy. From the accidental discovery in 1907 that scurvy could be induced in guinea pigs, to their use to prove the chemical structure of the \"ascorbutic factor '' in 1932 , the guinea pig model proved a crucial part of vitamin C research. However, for detailed information on vitamin C research involving guinea pigs, further resources would be needed.\n\n",

      "text": "Guinea pig\nThe guinea pig 's natural diet is grass ; their molars are particularly suited for grinding plant matter and grow continuously throughout their life . Most mammals that graze are large and have a long digestive tract ; guinea pigs have much longer colons than most rodents , but they must also supplement their diet by eating their feces ( coprophagy ) . However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion . The cecotropes are eaten directly from the anus , unless the guinea pig is pregnant or obese . They share this behaviour with rabbits . In geriatric boars or sows ( rarely in young ones ) , the muscles which allow the softer pellets to be expelled from the anus can become weak . This creates a condition known as `` anal impaction '' , which prevents the animal from redigesting cecotropes even though harder pellets may pass through the impacted mass . The condition may be temporarily alleviated by a human carefully removing the impacted feces from the anus .",

However , they do not consume all their feces indiscriminately , but produce special soft pellets , called cecotropes ( or caecal pellets ) , which recycle B vitamins , fiber , and bacteria required for proper digestion .Domestic guinea pigs, on the other hand, have a slightly different diet and may require a balanced diet of specially formulated guinea pig pellets, fresh vegetables, and hay.\n|user|: I meant c. tschudii specifically, but thank you for the information regarding the domesticated guinea pig.\n|assistant|: Cavia tschudii, which is believed to be the ancestor of the domesticated guinea pig, primarily eats grass in the wild. Like other species of cavies, they may also supplement their diet with feces (cecophagy), consuming special soft pellets called cecotropes for additional nutrients.\n|user|: Thanks for clarifying. Do they have predators?\n|assistant|: Yes, wild cavies, including Cavia tschudii, have predators. However, the documents do not provide specific information on what animals prey on them. As they are social animals that live in groups and are most active during dawn and dusk, they likely have predators that are active during those times and hunt by sight. These could include birds of prey, felids, and canids, among others.\n|user|: I'm told guinea pigs are raised for human consumption. Is that true?\n|assistant|: Yes, that is true. They were originally domesticated for their meat by tribes in the Andes, where they are a culinary staple, as early as 5000 BC  and are raised for human consumption ini Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia particularly in the Andes Mountain Highlands. They are a traditional source of protein in these regions and are often featured in local cuisine.

If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C , they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy . Guinea pigs require about 10 mg of vitamin C daily ( 20 mg if pregnant ) , which can be obtained through fresh , raw fruits and vegetables ( such as broccoli , apple , cabbage , carrot , celery , and spinach ) or through dietary supplements or by eating fresh pellets designed for guinea pigs , if they have been handled properly . Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium , magnesium , phosphorus , potassium , and hydrogen ions ; but adequate amounts of vitamins A , D , and E are also necessary .",
