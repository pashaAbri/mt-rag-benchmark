The European Union limits any financial compensation for donors to at most $1500 . In some countries , most notably Spain and Cyprus , this has limited donors to the poorest segments of society . In the United States , donors are paid regardless of how many eggs she produces . A donor 's compensation may increase for each additional time she provides eggs , especially if the donor 's eggs have a history of reliably resulting in the recipient becoming pregnant . In the United States , egg - broker agencies are known for advertising to college students who are more likely to be in financial situations that motivate them to participate for the financial compensation . It is not unusual for one student to donate many times . Often , this is done without consideration of potential long - term health consequences . Such a student is arguably not making the decision to donate her eggs autonomously due to her unfavorable financial situation .",

However, whether it can be considered a \"good business\" is subjective and depends on various factors such as the regulatory environment, societal acceptance, and ethical considerations. It's also important to note that such programs aim to help individuals and couples struggling with infertility and should prioritize their well-being above any commercial interests."
