  "input": "How many film adaptations of Hamlet are there?",
  "gold_answer": "I do not have specific information about the exact number of film adaptations of Hamlet. However, the earliest screen success recorded for Hamlet was Sara Bernhardt's 5-minute film of the fencing scene, which was produced in 1900. The film was an early attempt at combining sound and film , music and words were recorded on phonograph records , to be played along with the film . Seven silent versions were released from 1907-1921. Laurence Olivier adapted, produced, directed and starred in his screen version in 1948. Tony Richardson directed  the first Hamlet film in color in 1969. Franco A version by Franco Zeffirelli, with Mel Gibson and Glenn Close came out in 1990, and Kenneth Branagh's version was released in 1996. A version set in contemporary Manhattan and starring Ethan Hawke dates back to 2000. There have also been several films that transposed the general storyline of Hamlet or elements thereof to other settings . For example , the 2014 Bollywood film Haider is an adaptation set in Kashmir . There have also been many films which included performances of scenes from Hamlet as a play - within - a-film .",

      "text": "Romeo and Juliet\nRomeo and Juliet ranks with Hamlet as one of Shakespeare 's most performed plays . Its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories . Even in Shakespeare 's lifetime , it was extremely popular . Scholar Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare 's plays , in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London 's dominant playwright . The date of the first performance is unknown . The First Quarto , printed in 1597 , says that `` it hath been often ( and with great applause ) plaid publiquely '' , setting the first performance before that date . The Lord Chamberlain 's Men were certainly the first to perform it . Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare , the Second Quarto actually names one of its actors , Will Kemp , instead of Peter , in a line in Act Five . Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo , being the company 's actor , and Master Robert Goffe ( a boy ) the first Juliet . The premiere is likely to have been at `` The Theatre '' , with other early productions at `` The Curtain '' . Romeo and Juliet is one of the first Shakespearean plays to have been performed outside England : a shortened and simplified version was performed in N\u00f6rdlingen in 1604 .",

Branagh set the film with late 19th - century costuming and furnishings , a production in many ways reminiscent of a Russian novel of the time ; and Blenheim Palace , built in the early 18th century , became Elsinore Castle in the external scenes . The film is structured as an epic and makes frequent use of flashbacks to highlight elements not made explicit in the play : Hamlet 's sexual relationship with Kate Winslet 's Ophelia , for example , or his childhood affection for Yorick ( played by Ken Dodd ) .",
