  "gold_answer": "Purchasing stock doesn't affect your immediate taxes, however, selling stock has tax effects; if you sell the stocks for a profit, you will have a capital gain, which is subject to capital gains tax. If you sell them for a loss, you can use that to offset other capital gains or potentially deduct a certain amount from your taxable income.  It would be beneficial to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to understand the tax implications better. Regarding the \"zero dividend preference shares,\" they are designed to deliver gains as capital gains rather than income. This feature can be useful for tax efficiency, especially when making use of the annual capital gains tax allowance. However, these types of shares may have gone out of fashion due to a scandal around the year 2000.",

Consequently, if your portfolio is large enough to make transaction fees a very small percentage rate, this is a viable investment strategy.  However, as the preferred tax rate for dividends typically will catch up to that for capital gains at some cut-off point, there is a natural limit on how much income can be favourably obtained in this way.  If you believe your portfolio might be large enough to benefit from this investment strategy, talk to a qualified investment advisor, broker, or tax consultant for the specifics for your tax jurisdiction.",
