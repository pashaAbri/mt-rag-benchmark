        "text": "\nToday typically a Business needs to hold accounts in more than one currency. Banks in certain countries are offering what is called a dual currency account. It is essentially 2 accounts with same account number but different currency. So One can have an account number say 123456 and have it in say AUD and USD. So the balance will always show as X AUD and Y USD. If you deposit funds [electronic, check or cash] in USD; your USD balance goes up. Likewise at the time of withdrawal you have to specify what currency you are withdrawing. Interest rates are calculated at different percentage for different currencies.  So in a nutshell it would like operating 2 accounts, with the advantage of remembering only one account number. Designate a particular currency as default currency. So if you don't quote a currency along with the account number, it would be treated as default currency. Otherwise you always quote the account number and currency. Of-course bundled with other services like free Fx Advice etc it makes the entire proposition very attractive. Edit: If you have AUD 100 and USD 100, if you try and withdraw USD 110, it will not be allowed; Unless you also sign up for a auto sweep conversion.  If you deposit a GBP check into the account, by default it would get converted into AUD [assuming AUD is the default currency]",

    "original_text": "Yes, there are several advantages to using two bank accounts:\n1. Separation of finances: Having two bank accounts allows you to separate your personal and business finances, making it easier to keep track of expenses and income for each category.\n2. Better budgeting: By having two accounts, you can allocate funds for specific purposes, such as regular planned expenses (rent/mortgage, utility bills, insurance premiums) and savings. This can help you stick to a budget and avoid overspending.\n3. Protection against overdraft fees: By keeping a buffer in one account, you can reduce the risk of overdraft fees if you accidentally overspend.\n4. Easier tracking of expenses: With two accounts, you can easily see where your money is going and identify areas where you might be able to cut back on spending.\n5. More convenient: Having two accounts can make it easier to manage your money, especially if you have direct deposit set up for both accounts.\n6. Additional benefits: Some banks offer additional benefits for having multiple accounts, such as higher interest rates or waived fees.\nIt's important to note that while there are advantages to having two bank accounts, there may also be requirements to maintain a minimum balance or set up direct deposit. Be sure to check with your bank for specific details."
