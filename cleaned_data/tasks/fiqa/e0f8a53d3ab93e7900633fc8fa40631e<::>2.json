However, it's crucial to understand what you're investing in, including the company's products, and to buy stock in good companies at good prices, considering factors like price to earnings, price to revenue, and price to book. Therefore, while following an investment guru can provide valuable insights, it's essential to conduct your own research and make informed decisions based on your understanding and investment goals. Blindly following other investors, including big investors or gurus, is not recommended, as their strategies may differ from yours. Instead, consider finding someone with similar goals to help guide your investment decisions.\n|user|: name a few gurus"

      "text": "\nBuffett is a value investor. His goal is to buy good companies when the market is overly worried and prices them below intrinsic value. When the market is highly priced it is much more difficult for him to find things that he thinks are at an attractive price. When people are very worried and the market has crashed, stocks are then priced below their intrinsic value and he can use the cash he keeps in the company to make attractive purchases. Remember that Buffett is not concerned with the ups and downs of the price of Berkshire Hathaway stock, he is concerned with the economic value of the assets that the company owns. So if all stock prices crash and he can buy things that are at bargain prices, he is happy no matter what Berkshire stock price does in the short run. One consequence of value investing is that because you are buying assets at bargain prices, the total value of your assets drops less in a bear market than the highly priced stuff that drives the major indexes.",

He buys what he knows and looks for companies that generate cash and/or are available for a discount of their true value. He explains what he looks for in a company and his reasons for buying it. He has said on numerous occasions, \"\"I look for intrinsic value.\"\" (So there's your formula.) Human nature is often  irrational and investing seems to bring out the fear and greed. I've always been a bit surprised when people ascribe some sort of sixth sense to Warren Buffet's success. He just works hard and doesn't deviate from a sound strategy. \"\"Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.\"\" And of course, rule one: \"\"Don't lose money.\"\" It's not a joke. How many people buy high and sell low because of fear and greed? When the market tanks, buy more. Finally, anyone can invest with Buffet without all the work. Just buy a few shares of BRK.A or BRK.B.\"",
