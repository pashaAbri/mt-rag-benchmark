  "gold_answer": "The market cap is simply the share price multiplied by the number of shares. It doesn't indicate any inherent value; rather, it reflects what people believe the company is worth. NAV, or net asset value, is the total value of the company's assets divided by the number of shares. This is also referred to as the book value. In summary, market cap is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of shares.",

It doesn't represent any value (if people decide to pay more or less for the shares, the market cap goes up or down). It does represent what people think the company is worth.  NAV sounds very much like book value. It basically says \"\"how much cash would we end up with if we sold everything the company owns, paid back all the debt, and closed down the business? \"\" Since closing down the business is rarely a good idea, this underestimates the value of the business enormously. Take a hairdresser who owns nothing but a pair of scissors, but has a huge number of repeat customers, charges $200 for a haircut, and makes tons of money every year. The business has a huge value, but NAV = price of one pair of used scissors.\"",

Because investors believe Amazon is worth a lot more than a money losing company with a NAV of 22.",
