It was only 7 years ago that the first generation started becoming available.  If progress continues at the pace it has up to now, then by 2025 we might see the 3rd gen EVs appearing and I expect they'll have 300+ range starting around $25K.  EV infrastructure is easy peasy to install.  All you have to do is pick an electrician out of the phone book.  Apartments, parking garages, and hotels will all have to start installing level 1 and level 2 chargers, if they want customers.",

If you assume that full production capacity for cars is about 20M then (assuming 100% of production is switched to EV) it will take 11.5 years at full tilt to just replace the ones on the road.   But of course there will be a ramp and a tail meaning cars will be sold in 2024 that are not electric only and they will be on the road for 15 years.   Also the market will grow to say 25M but instead of adding 5M capacity, we would really have to add 25M capacity b.c EV is currently 0.   Thats all assuming there isnt a recession/depression and ignores trucks and ships and all the other uses for oil.   I thought this article was posted to /r/badeconomics",

I wouldn't be surprising to see EVs take a significant share of the auto market in the coming years (they were ~1% in 2016).  Innovation drives economic growth.  It's also good for the environment (the electricity used is much cleaner than gasoline/diesel) and electrical grid (increased demand that's potentially responsive to system load helps finance smart grid improvements).",

However, I can tell you that buying a used electric vehicle can be a good option for those looking to save money while still enjoying the benefits of electric powertrains. Factors to consider when buying a used EV include battery health, charging infrastructure availability, and government incentives. Additionally, it's important to research the specific make and model to understand any common issues or recalls."
