  "gold_answer": "When paying with cash for a car, you need to get a cashier's check made out for the amount. Note that dealers may not accept personal checks as they may bounce. You would typically pay a deposit of $500, which can be a check or bank deposit after negotiation. Then, you can return to the dealership later the same day or within a few days with a cashier's check for the remaining amount. Keep in mind that if you give the dealership $10,000 or more in actual cash, they will be required to fill out a form 8300 with the IRS.",

      "text": "\nWhen you pay cash for a car, you don't always necessarily need to pay cash. You just aren't using credit or a loan is all. A few options you have are: Obviously no dealer expects anyone to just have the cash laying around for a car worth a few thousand dollars, nor would you bother going to your bank or credit union for the cash. You can simply get a cashier's check made out for the amount. Note that dealers may not accept personal checks as they may bounce.  After negotiations at the dealer, you would explain you're paying cash, likely pay a deposit (depending on the price of the car, but $500 would probably be enough. Again, the deposit can be a check or bank deposit), and then come back later on with a cashier's check, or deposit into a bank account. You would be able to do this later that day or within a few days, but since you've purchased a new car you would probably want to return ASAP!",
