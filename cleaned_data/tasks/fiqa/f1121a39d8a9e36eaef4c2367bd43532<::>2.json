    "text": "One of the reason most small businesses fail it is because banks usually know that small businesses are a huge risk and are unwilling to provide loans for them to survive. They aren't able to survive in the short-term no matter how good the prospects are in the long-term. They work crazy long hours and submit themselves to huge financial risk. Most owners have no interest in taking true responsibility for the company's health and in the end business has one imperative: to make money. Moreover some small owners business are lacked of some  intangible qualities of entrepreneurship. They  put in loads of commitment or loads of money into an idea that just isn't right. Or they spend money in the wrong ways.                                   ",

        "text": "\nI don't have any experience in this, but this is my academic understanding of business pricing.  The LOWEST amount a seller would accept is the liquidation value. For a B&B, what would the value of the land, the house, the furnishings, accounts payable, etc. be if it had to be sold today, minus any liabilities.  The amount the seller would like to pay for is going to be a multiple of its annual earnings. One example of this is the discounted cash flow analysis. You determine the EBITDA, the earnings a company generated, before interest,  depreciation, taxation and amortization.  Once you have this amount, you can project it out in perpetuity, or you use an industry multiplier.  Perpetuity:  You project this value out in perpituity, discounted by the going interest rate. In other words, if you project the business will earn $100,000/year, the business should grow at a 5% rate, and the going interest rate is 8%. Using a growing perpetuity formula, one value of a business would be: 100,000 / (.08 - .03) = $2,000,000.  This is a very high number, and the seller would love to get it.  It's more common to do a multiple of the EBIDTA. You can do some research into the valuation of the particular industry to figure out the EBIDTA multiplier for the industry. For example, this article suggests that the 2011 EBITDA multiplier for hospitality industries is 13.8. (It's valuing large hotel chains, but it's a start). So the value of this B&B would be around $1,380,000. Here is an online SME valuation tool to help with the EBIDTA multiple based valuation. Also, from my research, it looks like many small business use Seller Discretionary Earnings  (SDE) instead of EBITDA. I don't know much about it, but it seems to serve a similar purpose as EBITDA.  A potential buyer should request the financial statements of the business for the last few years to determine the value of the business, and then can negotiate with the owner a price. You would probably want to enlist a broker to help you with the transaction.",

        "text": "\n\"EBITDA is in my opinion not a useful measure for an investor looking to buy shares on the stock market. It is more useful for private businesses open to changing their structuring, or looking to sell significant parts of their business. One of the main benefits of reporting Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization, is that it presents the company as it would look to a potential buyer. Consider that net income, as a metric, includes interest costs, taxes, and depreciation. Interest costs are (to put it simply) a result of multiplying a business's debt by its interest rate. If you own a business, and personally guarantee the loan that the company has with the bank, your interest rates might be artificially low. If you have a policy of reaching high debt levels relative to your equity, in order to achieve high 'financial leveraging', your interest cost might be artificially high. Either way, if I bought your business, my debt structure could be completely different, and therefore your interest costs are not particularly relevant to me, a potential buyer. Instead, I should attempt to anticipate what my own interest costs would be, under my plans for your business. Taxes are a result of many factors, including the corporate structure of the business. If you run your business as a sole proprietorship (ie: no corporation), but I want to buy it under my corporation, then my tax rates could look nothing like yours. Or if we operated in multiple jurisdictions. etc. etc. Instead of using your taxes as an estimate for mine, I should anticipate my taxes based on my plans for your business. Depreciation / amortization is a measure that estimates how much of a business's \"\"fixed assets\"\" were \"\"used up\"\" during the year. ie: how much wear and tear occurred on your fleet of trucks? It is generally calculated as a % of your overall asset value. It is a (very loose) proxy for the cash costs which will ultimately be incurred to make repairs/replacements. D&A is also something which could significantly change if a business changes hands.",

EBITDA is your accounting profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. So it's already free of many non-cash items, and is closer to a cash-basis measure of profit, but still includes many non-cash revenues.   As far as I know, the discounting is to take the time value of money into account so you can make a decision on whether the present value of the expected future cash flows are greater than the present value of the cash outflow being asked today.

If you're really gung-ho about it and willing to take a big risk, I've heard many people say the same reason that a small business fails - not enough cash flow. You might be lucky to raise enough capital for start-up costs, but can you survive two years of negative income? And I'm not even talking about your personal living expenses. Forget about that, you're going to be living at home eating ramen. I'm talking about having enough cash to pay the rent and keep the lights on. Unfortunately, it's going to be a vicious cycle because banks know small businesses are a huge risk and are unwilling to provide loans for them to survive...but small businesses fail because they aren't able to survive in the short-term no matter how good the prospects are in the long-term.   Your safest bet is to grow organically. This means having a business model with negligible start-up costs and little overhead costs. Your inventory is going to be small and because of that, your margins are going to be thin (no wholesale prices). But at this point, based on the products you're selling, you're basically just another one of the millions of internet re-sellers. You're going to basically have to place all your value in getting savvy to learn how to spot good deals and re-sell products for a higher price.   Honestly, I'll be harsh about it. You have 0 competitive advantage and offer 0 extra value in your idea. There's really no point in wasting your time and money unless you can pivot the idea so you're creating actual competitive advantages for yourself. Otherwise, just stick to re-selling online, at the very least to get a feel for the profit margins and gain experience.",

Or they spend money in the wrong ways - you know how all these internet companies spent money on champagne breakfasts and $1000 chairs during the dot-com bubble? I've seen the small-scale version of that, as people rent expensive offices when I'm thinking \"\"why aren't you just working from home?\"\"   As a (small time) entrepreneur I'm obviously biased, but if you've got what it takes (so I think there is an element of \"\"predestination\"\" here) and you work hard then you *will* succeed, to some greater or lesser extent.  I mean, I know electricians and builders that have started their own contracting or supplies businesses - they're not rich by the standard of mutli-multimillionaires, but they have a bloody nice house and a bloody nice car in the driveway and they probably take an afternoon a week off to play golf. They're doing better than most of the other guys they worked with as electricians or builders 20 years ago, and I don't see that they're really doing anything too clever or sophisticated.   Also, the classic figure of 9/10 businesses failed - \"\"failed\"\" here is a very dramatic word, implying that the entrepreneur lost his or her shirt. Often it's not a case that the business lost them money - they pissed away thousands on rent or wages or misplaced marketing - but more that it made a bit of money, but not enough, so they moved on to something else. That something else might be regular employment for some people, but there are *plenty* of entrepreneurs - perhaps some of the greatest and most famous ones - who have gone on from one failure to a much bigger success.\"",
