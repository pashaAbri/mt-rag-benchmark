As for whether it pays, real estate agents typically make a commission of 3% to 3.5% of the sale price of a property, which can vary depending on the location and the sale price. However, earnings can be unpredictable and depend on various factors such as the number of transactions and the sale prices of the properties. And they only get paid if the house sells.",

        "text": "\nApplying for a mortgage is a bit of paperwork, but not too bad of an experience. Rates are pretty tight, if one lender were more that 1/4% lower than another, they'd be inundated with applications. Above a certain credit score, you get the 'best' rate, a search will show you the rates offered in your area.  If you are a first time buyer, there are mortgages that might benefit you. If you are a vet (for non-native English readers, a veteran who served in the US armed forces, not a veterinarian, who is an animal doctor) there are mortgages that offer low-to-no down payment with attractive rates.  Yes, avoid PMI, it's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase. If banks qualify you for different amounts, it shouldn't be a huge difference, a few percent variation. But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36. But I wouldn't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase, that's asking for trouble.",

What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates. However, in a seller's market, buyers with VA loans may face challenges as some sellers might prefer offers with fewer barriers. Have you looked at conventional financing rather than VA? VA loans are not always a great deal. Conventional tends to be the best, and FHA being better than VA. It is also important to note that veterans can  make themselves more appealing to sellers with non-VA loans.\n|user|: Benefits of FHA loan?\n|assistant|: FHA is an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan. An FHA loan has several benefits. Firstly, it only requires a 3.5% down payment and allows for lower credit scores compared to traditional mortgages. This makes it a viable option for first-time homebuyers or those with limited credit history. Secondly, the PMI costs associated with FHA loans can be reduced by the size of the down payment. However, it's important to note that FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan, which can increase the overall cost of the mortgage.\n|user|: Do I need a real estate agent?\n|assistant|: Whether or not you need a real estate agent depends on your individual needs and circumstances. In the United States, the seller typically pays the real estate agent fee. If you don't have an agent, you may miss out on their expertise in explaining contract terms, advising you on making offers, the option to do inspections. While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls.\n|user|: How to become a real estate agent and does it pay?"

Fannie May and Freddie Mac could care less, and FHA and VA backed loans allow for full gifting unless the buyer's credit is below the standard 620, then 3.5% must come from the buyer. Standard bank loans want to know the source of the down payment for ONE REASON ONLY: to know if the buyer is taking ON A NEW DEBT! The only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift.  That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale. Get it? They just want to know how many hands are in the fire.",

Once you get below 20% loan to value, you can petition the mortgage company to remove the PMI (with conventional loans; VA and FHA have lifetime PMI). If it was me, I'd do one of two things.  Both involve paying off the student loan now.  The savings from the student loan payment will assist you in helping you meet one of the two goals below.  Also both involve getting a 15 year fixed. The first would be to buy the house now, and work like crazy to get rid of the PMI.  My goal would be to get rid of this within 18 months.   The second would be to save up enough cash for the 20% down and then buy the house.  You'd miss out on the house you are looking at, which is kind of heartbreaking.  Who is to say that a better home does not come along at the same price?  My goal would be to have the downpayment in 9 months, and really try to have it in 6 months. Being an old guy that has experience how much of a virtue patience is, I'd recommend the second option.",

        "text": "\n\"Here in the U.S., a realtor can act as a \"\"seller's agent\"\" or a \"\"buyer's agent\"\". I think what you are calling a \"\"broker\"\" in the U.S. we call a \"\"buyer's agent\"\", and this may just be a difference in terminology, from your post it sounds like the concept is the same. I am answering from a U.S. perspective, please let me know if something doesn't make sense in the Israeli context. Here, each typically gets 3% to 3.5% of the sale price (at least in my part of the country). So yes, the buyer's agent has an incentive to get a higher price, even though this is contrary to the interests of the person he is supposed to represent. On the other hand, the buyer's agent has a strong incentive to find a house at a price that you consider acceptable. If the absolute most you are willing to pay is, say, \u20aa1,000,000, and he keeps showing you houses that cost \u20aa1,500,000, he's just wasting his time. (He's wasting your time too, of course, but let's assume he doesn't care about that.) (I don't know what housing prices are in Israel today, just making up numbers.) Suppose he has two houses that he can show you, one in your price range and one not. If he shows you the first you may buy it and we will very quickly get his commission. If he shows you the second, you probably won't buy it and he'll get zero. If he keeps showing you houses above your price range, he's doing a bunch of work for which he will never be paid. The worst case from your point of view is if you're thinking that you're expecting and prepared to pay, say, \u20aa1,000,000 to \u20aa1,300,000, and you tell the broker that, his incentive is to concentrate on the upper end, maybe even push it a little.",
