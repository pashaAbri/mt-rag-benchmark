  "input": "What is the ideal formula to evaluate a company?",
  "gold_answer": "There isn't a single \"ideal\" formula to evaluate a company, as the appropriate metrics can vary depending on the company's specific circumstances, industry, and objectives. However, three main areas to focus on are the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement. The standard measure for evaluating income is the P/E (price-earnings) ratio. The debt-to-equity or debt-to-capital ratio (debt + equity) is important for the balance sheet. When assessing cash generation, the price-to-cash flow or price-to-free cash flow ratios are helpful (the lower the ratio, the better, all other things being equal, for all three ratios). Common financial ratios and metrics to consider include the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio, Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio, Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio, and Return on Investment (ROI), among others.",

The primary reason, imho, could be the company is in a state of retiring stock with debt. The company is selling penny stocks (only to get people more interested in it's later development) which are inherently undervalued. There may be other reasons, but definitely check out both articles.",
