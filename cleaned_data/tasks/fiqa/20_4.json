  "gold_answer": "Creating a single global market would be quite complex and challenging for several reasons. First, each country has its own exchange, which is closely tied to its local currency. Exchanges primarily support transactions and settlements in their local currency, and securities are denominated in a single currency. Cross-currency translation would complicate the trading process, as it would require additional steps and considerations.\nFurthermore, citizens and businesses in most countries are restricted to having bank accounts in local currency, making it difficult or impossible to open a domestic bank account in a foreign-denominated currency. A public company headquartered in a given country is more likely to do business with local citizenry and businesses in that currency, and thus look for investors from the same pool, which generally means listing in local currency on an exchange in that country.\n",

If an \"\"unexpected world events\"\" occurs, the volume/liquidity will most certainly increase. Another example is the Forex Market that's open 24/7 around the world. As one major forex market closes, another one opens. According to GMT,   for instance, forex trading hours move around the world like this:   available in New York between 01:00 pm \u2013 10:00 pm GMT; at 10:00 pm GMT   Sydney comes online; Tokyo opens at 00:00 am and closes at 9:00 am   GMT; and to complete the loop, London opens at 8:00 am and closes at   05:00 pm GMT. This enables traders and brokers worldwide, together   with the participation of the central banks from all continents, to   trade online 24 hours a day. src\"",

                  "model_text": "|user|: how does pre-market trading work?\n|assistant|: Pre-market trading takes place before the regular trading hours (RTH) of the stock market. For example, pre-market hours are from 4:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on the NASDAQ stock market. During pre-market hours, you can place limit orders, but you cannot place market orders due to lower liquidity. This is because the volume and liquidity are generally much lower during pre-market hours compared to RTH. If an unexpected world event occurs, the volume and liquidity might increase. It is important to note that not all brokers allow pre-market trading, and if they do, you might need to specify that you want your order to be executed during pre-market hours.\n|user|: what are limit orders vs market orders?\n|assistant|: A limit order is a type of order where you set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell a security. The order will only be executed if the market price reaches the price you set. On the other hand, a market order is an order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current market price. Market orders do not guarantee a specific price, and the final execution price may be different from the price quoted at the time of order entry.\nThe choice between limit orders and market orders depends on your trading goals and risk tolerance. \n|user|: if I'm in the US how can I buy / sell on other countries markets?\n|assistant|: If you're in the US and want to buy or sell securities on other countries' markets, you generally have two options. Some large brokers offer trading access to popular equity markets in other countries, such as the Toronto Stock Exchange, Mexico Stock Exchange, or London Stock Exchange. One such broker is Interactive Brokers, offering many foreign markets (19 countries) for US-based investors, allowing you to trade all these local markets within one universal account, which can be very convenient. However, at many brokers or in less popular foreign markets, you typically must open an account with a broker in that country. \n|user|: why isn't there just one global market? wouldn't that be easier?"

There is no global stock price, the price relates to the last price a stock was traded at on a particular stock market. However, a company can be listed on more than one stock exchange. For example, some Australian companies are listed both on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and the NYSE, and they usually trade at different prices on the different exchanges. Also, there is no formula to determine a stock price. In your example where C wants to buy at 110 and B wants to sell at 120, there will be no sale until one or both of them decides to change their bid or offer to match the opposite, or until new buyers and/or sellers come into the market closing the gap between the buy and sell prices and creating more liquidity. It is all to do with supply and demand and peoples' emotions.",

Generally, an exchange will support transaction and settlement only in local currency.  Securities (except those that explicitly enable FX trading) are denominated and will trade in a single currency-- you can only buy a share of IBM in U.S. dollars.  Securities trading always seeks to be a clean, frictionless, scalable process, and adding cross-currency translation to the mix would just complicate things.  So it's one exchange, one currency. In most countries, citizens and even businesses are largely restricted to having bank accounts in local currency.  There are various political reasons for this, but there it is:  it is difficult or impossible to open a domestic bank account in a foreign-denominated currency.  A public company headquartered in a given country will be required to publish financial statements in local currency, will be more likely to do business with the local citizenry and businesses in that currency, and so will likely look for investors from that same pool-- which generally means listing in local currency, which means on an exchange in that country. There are exceptions, of course.  Big multinationals do business all over the world, and many seek investors all over the world as well.  Mechanisms have been created to permit this (American Depositary Receipts or ADRs, for example).  But once again, cross-currency translation makes things more complicated, so ADRs and their like are only practical for very big international players. As to why there may be many exchanges in a single country, IMO Nick R has it right.  Read \"\"Flash Boys\"\"; many market makers profit from trading between exchanges, and so have an interest in there being many of them.  And in the U.S., regulators have expressed an interest in \"\"innovation\"\" in the exchange space, and so permit them.  There is also an argument to be made against having a single \"\"Too Big To Fail\"\" exchange just like the argument for banks, but I wouldn't call that a \"\"reason\"\" for the current state of affairs.\"",
