  "gold_answer": "Yes, the choice between FIFO and LIFO can indeed complicate the bookkeeping process.  If you instruct your broker to sell shares purchased in specific lots, they can do that.  Brokers now are required to keep track of cost basis and report it to the IRS on the 1099-B.  Also, business bookkeeping services may help you in all aspect of managing your accounts and financial data within the accounting software such as QuickBooks, MYOB, and Peachtree.",

If you instruct your broker to sell shares purchased in specific lots, they can do that -- but doing so requires that you and/or they track specific fractional lots forever afterwards so you know what is still there to be sold. FIFO simplifies the bookkeeping. And I am not convinced selecting specific lots makes much difference; the government gets its share of your profits sooner or later.",

Brokers now are required to keep track of cost basis and report it to the IRS on the 1099-B, so you have to tell the broker which position it is that you're closing. Usually, the default is FIFO (i.e.: when you sell, you're assumed to be closing the oldest position), but you can change it if you want. In the US you cannot average costs basis of stocks (you can for mutual funds), so you either do FIFO, LIFO (last position closed first), or specify the specific positions when you submit the sale order.",
