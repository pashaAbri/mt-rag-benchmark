  "gold_answer": "Whether or not you need a real estate agent depends on your individual needs and circumstances. In the United States, the seller typically pays the real estate agent fee. If you don't have an agent, you may miss out on their expertise in explaining contract terms, advising you on making offers, the option to do inspections. While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls.",

      "text": "\nApplying for a mortgage is a bit of paperwork, but not too bad of an experience. Rates are pretty tight, if one lender were more that 1/4% lower than another, they'd be inundated with applications. Above a certain credit score, you get the 'best' rate, a search will show you the rates offered in your area.  If you are a first time buyer, there are mortgages that might benefit you. If you are a vet (for non-native English readers, a veteran who served in the US armed forces, not a veterinarian, who is an animal doctor) there are mortgages that offer low-to-no down payment with attractive rates.  Yes, avoid PMI, it's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase. If banks qualify you for different amounts, it shouldn't be a huge difference, a few percent variation. But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36. But I wouldn't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase, that's asking for trouble.",

                "model_text": "|user|: My friend wants to put my name down for a house he's buying. What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates. However, in a seller's market, buyers with VA loans may face challenges as some sellers might prefer offers with fewer barriers. Have you looked at conventional financing rather than VA? VA loans are not always a great deal. Conventional tends to be the best, and FHA being better than VA. It is also important to note that veterans can  make themselves more appealing to sellers with non-VA loans.\n|user|: Benefits of FHA loan?\n|assistant|: FHA is an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan. An FHA loan has several benefits. Firstly, it only requires a 3.5% down payment and allows for lower credit scores compared to traditional mortgages. This makes it a viable option for first-time homebuyers or those with limited credit history. Secondly, the PMI costs associated with FHA loans can be reduced by the size of the down payment. However, it's important to note that FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan, which can increase the overall cost of the mortgage.\n|user|: Do I need a real estate agent?"

      "text": "\nOmg, the answer is easy. Tell the TRUTH, and nothing is fraud. Down payment gifts are SOP's, and every lender works with that. EACH lender has their own rules. Fannie May and Freddie Mac could care less, and FHA and VA backed loans allow for full gifting unless the buyer's credit is below the standard 620, then 3.5% must come from the buyer. Standard bank loans want to know the source of the down payment for ONE REASON ONLY: to know if the buyer is taking ON A NEW DEBT! The only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift.  That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale. Get it? They just want to know how many hands are in the fire.",

What warranty will exist if the A/C dies this summer?  If you still want help from an agent one should be able to help for far less than the normal commission. The seller normally interviews three agents before selecting one, do the same in this situation. Ask how much they would charge for a sale between friends. They can complete their task in just a couple of hours. If the home inspection comes back relatively clean, the transaction should be very easy. The paperwork is the biggest hurdle. You should jointly identify a local settlement company. They will be the ones actually filing the paperwork. They have lawyers. They will check the county records office for existing liens, plats, mortgages and address all the issues. They can send the proper paperwork to the existing mortgage companies and arrange for mortgage insurance. The cost will be the same regardless of the presence of real estate agents and other lawyers.  When they say a lawyer is required, it is only because of the paperwork.",

      "text": "\nFor example: do I need a realtor, or can I do their job myself? In general in the United States the real estate agent fee is paid by the seller of the property. Their agent will be more than happy keep the entire fee if they don't have to split it with your agent.  If you don't have an agent you will be missing somebody who can help you find the property that meets your needs. They can also help explain what the different parts of the contract mean and give you advice regarding making an offer. Do I need to pay for an inspection, or am I likely to save enough   money from skipping it to cover potential problems that they would   have caught? Inspections are optional. Though the amount you are risking is the entire value of the purchase. If the property has a problem in the foundation, or the septic system, or the plumbing or electrical the cost to fix the issue could render the purchase not worth doing. If you discover the problem a year later and you have to repair the house and have to find temporary housing for a few months, you will regret skipping the inspection. What are some of the ways I can cut expenses on closing costs? Is   there any low-hanging fruit? You need to do your homework. When you are ready to purchase a property take good look at the good faith estimate and look at each item.  Ask them what the expense covers. Push back against those that seem optional or excessive. Keep in mind that moving the closing date from the end of a month to the start of the next month only changes the timing those charges, it doesn't really save you money. Rolling the costs into the loan sound easy but you have to think about. It means that you will be paying interest on those charges for the life of the loan. It is good that you are starting to think about all the costs.",

Similarly the escrow companies that usually deal with recording and disbursing of money. You will probably not be able to get a title insurance without using an escrow service (I'm guessing here, but it makes sense to me). You will not be able to secure financing through a bank or a mortgage broker without an escrow company, and it might be hard without an agent. Agents required by law to know all the details of the process, and they can guide you through what to do and what to look into. They have experience reading and understanding the inspection reports, they know what to demand from the seller (disclosures, information, etc), they know how and from where to get the HOA docs and disclosures, and can help you negotiate the price knowing the market information (comparable sales, comparable listings, list vs sales statistics, etc). It is hard to do all that alone, but if you do - you should definitely get a discount over the market price of the property of about 5% (the agents' fees are up to 5% mostly). I bought several properties in California and in other states, and I wouldn't do it without an agent on my side. But if you trust the other side entirely and willing to take the risk of missing a step and having problems later with title, mortgage, insurance or resale, then you can definitely save some money and do it without an agent, and there are people doing that.",
