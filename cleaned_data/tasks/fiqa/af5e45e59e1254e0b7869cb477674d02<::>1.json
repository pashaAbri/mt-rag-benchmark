        "text": "\nYes it is true. The US based companies have to meet the requirements placed on them by the US government. The agency with all these reports is the Security and Exchange Commission. They run the EDGAR system to hold all those required reports The SEC\u2019s EDGAR database provides free public access to corporate   information, allowing you to quickly research a company\u2019s financial   information and operations by reviewing registration statements,   prospectuses and periodic reports filed on Forms 10-K and 10-Q. You   also can find information about recent corporate events reported on   Form 8-K but that a company does not have to disclose to investors. EDGAR also provides access to comment and response letters relating to   disclosure filings made after August 1, 2004, and reviewed by either   the Division of Corporation Finance or the Division of Investment   Management. On May 22, 2006, the staffs of the Divisions of   Corporation Finance and Investment Management began to use the EDGAR   system to issue notifications of effectiveness for Securities Act   registration statements and post-effective amendments, other than   those that become effective automatically by law. These notifications   will be posted to the EDGAR system the morning after a filing is   determined to be effective. As pointed out by Grade 'Eh' Bacon: Other countries may require different types of information to be reported to the public, in particular, financial statements. To find the financial statements released for a particular company, you can go to the appropriate stock exchange, or often simply the company's corporate website.",

    "original_text": "The documents provided do not contain specific information about the system that the SEC requires companies to use when preparing financial statements. However, they do mention that the SEC's EDGAR database provides access to corporate information, including financial statements, and that these financial statements can often be found on the appropriate stock exchange or the company's corporate website. Additionally, it is mentioned that publicly traded companies file 10-Ks with the SEC, which include financial statement information and are searchable on the EDGAR system. If a 10-K is marked \"Interactive Data\", the SEC has broken out the financial information into standard formats, making it easier to compare."
