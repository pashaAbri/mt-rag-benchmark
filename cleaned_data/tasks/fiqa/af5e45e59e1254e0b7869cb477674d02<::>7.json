  "gold_answer": "In the United States vs. O'Hagan case, the Supreme Court set a precedent for interpreting SEC Rule 10(b) by using the \"misappropriation theory.\" This theory states that misappropriating confidential information for securities trading purposes, in breach of a duty owed to the source of that information, requires disclosure or abstention. From a legal perspective, the rules are anything but clear outside of company insiders. However, your own admission is consistent with what anyone in the securities industry knows is true - if you trade on material non-public information, you risk being charged. It's possible to commit normal fraud all day long, and the SEC won't lift a finger, but as soon as you get within a hundred miles of an insider trading deal, they'll come down on you like a ton of bricks. It's an easy case to prove; there is no question about its illegality (even the janitor is expected to take a class on it), and the SEC was specifically set up to stop it after the Great Depression.",

You're correct that from a legal perspective the rules are anything but clear outside of company insiders. However, your own admission is consistent with what anyone in the securities industry knows is true - if you trade on material non-public information, you risk being charged.  I think most would conclude that it's unethical irrespective of the letter of the law. It damages the integrity and functioning of markets. Furthermore, if the law was clarified, I think it's highly unlikely it would state \"\"trading on material non-public information is permissible for anyone who is not a company insider\"\". Instead, I would expect it to be consistent with \"\"Trading on material non-public information is illegal. If in doubt, abstain.\"\" And this is exactly what the government officials should be doing - abstaining.\"",
