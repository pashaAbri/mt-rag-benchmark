  "input": "What is WACC?",
  "gold_answer": "The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is a formula that helps determine the cost for a company to raise $1 of capital, whether through issuing bonds or stocks. It is a standard tool used by finance professionals. Ideally, you would want a WACC similar to other successful companies of your size and industry. Adjusting your WACC involves issuing or repurchasing equity or debt.",

      "text": "\nIf you want to see a more academic version of this look up Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).   It's a formula that tells you how much it costs for a company to raise $1 of capital whether it be through issuing bonds or stocks.   One thing you learn is that there are times that if you take on loans (even if you don't need it) you can raise shareholder value and therefore the total company netvalue. The thought process is (as it states in the article above) that a company can issue debt for cheaper than issue shares and it will have extra cash which it can use to get a better return than its net effective interest rate.   I tried to give an example but I only ended up rehashing what it says in the article. Anyhow look up WACC and you'll understand the fundamentals.",

      "text": "\n\"No, I understood your question perfectly. I'm just saying that sort of situation is generally rare. A quick Google search yields [this article] (http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1112/small-business-financing-debt-or-equity.aspx) which responds to the question - Which funding method should I choose? with the answer \"\"Often you will not have a choice\"\". That is exactly what I'm saying. The status and stage of your business dictates what sort of financing is even available to you. Most often you don't even have a choice between one or the other. If you want a formula, the other people responding mentioned [WACC] (http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/wacc.asp) which is the \"\"standard\"\" that finance professionals typically use. You generally will want a WACC that is similar to other successful companies of your similar size and industry. The actual mechanics of adjusting your WACC will involve either issuing (or repurchasing) equity or debt. Regardless, what you are asking is not generally practical nor does it come into practice in 99 out of 100 financing situations. WACC is important to understand and consider but people don't issue equity or debt just to balance their WACC. Think about this another way... how easy is it to raise debt? Probably fairly easy as usually you can go to commercial banks or go to an investment bank if you're raising enough debt. Companies borrow all of the time, they're constantly paying off loans or taking new ones with different interest rates. There are revolving lines of credit, secured loans, factoring (borrowing against receivables), EETCs, fixed interest debt, variable interest debt, mezzanine debt, etc etc. How easy is it to issue equity? Pretty amazingly difficult... sure you have your IPOs but that happens once in a company's lifetime.",
