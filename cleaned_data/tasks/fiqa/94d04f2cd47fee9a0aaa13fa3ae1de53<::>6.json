There may be one, two, three, or more of you, but you all start working at about the same time, and you all take the same risk: quitting your jobs to work for a new and unproven company. \nThe second layer is the first actual employees. By the time you hire this layer, you've got cash coming in from somewhere (investors or customers\u2014doesn't matter). These people didn't take as much risk because they got a salary from day one, and honestly, they didn't start the company, they joined it as a job. The third layer consists of later employees. By the time they joined the company, it was going pretty well. Each \"layer\" will be approximately one year for many companies. When your company is big enough to sell to Google or go public, you probably have about six layers: the founders and roughly five layers of employees. Each successive layer is more significant. It's very important to keep your employees happy and ensure they feel part of something other than a job. Make them feel like they're part of a family and support system.",

There may be 1, 2, 3, or more of you, but you all start working about the same time, and you all take the same risk... quitting your jobs to go work for a new and unproven company. The second layer is the first real employees. By the time you hire this layer, you've got cash coming in from somewhere (investors or customers--doesn't matter). These people didn't take as much risk because they got a salary from day one, and honestly, they didn't start the company, they joined it as a job. The third layer are later employees. By the time they joined the company, it was going pretty well. For many companies, each \"\"layer\"\" will be approximately one year long. By the time your company is big enough to sell to Google or go public or whatever, you probably have about 6 layers: the founders and roughly five layers of employees. Each successive layer is larger. There might be two founders, five early employees in layer 2, 25 employees in layer 3, and 200 employees in layer 4. The later layers took less risk. OK, now here's how you use that information: The founders should end up with about 50% of the company, total. Each of the next five layers should end up with about 10% of the company, split equally among everyone in the layer. Example: Two founders start the company. They each take 2500 shares. There are 5000 shares outstanding, so each founder owns half. They hire four employees in year one. These four employees each take 250 shares. There are 6000 shares outstanding. They hire another 20 employees in year two. Each one takes 50 shares. They get fewer shares because they took less risk, and they get 50 shares because we're giving each layer 1000 shares to divide up. By the time the company has six layers, you have given out 10,000 shares. Each founder ends up owning 25%. Each employee layer owns 10% collectively.",

    "original_text": "Employees play a crucial role in the success of a business. While the ultimate goal of a business is to generate profits, it cannot be achieved without the hard work and dedication of its employees. Business owners should ensure that their employees are well-compensated, motivated, and treated fairly. This not only helps in maintaining a positive work environment but also contributes to the overall growth and success of the business. Employees who feel valued and appreciated are more likely to be productive and contribute positively to the decision-making process of the business. Therefore, while profits are essential for a business to survive, it is equally important to prioritize the well-being and satisfaction of employees."
