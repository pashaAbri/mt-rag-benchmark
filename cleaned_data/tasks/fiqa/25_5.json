I'm not sure if anyone noticed but the economy and consumer confidence is in the toilet. If business owners arent careful it very well could collapse and in the end if it does fail there is nobody else responsible but themselves.  So in times of success, yes the business owners reap profit, but in tough times so too do they have to take full responsibility and consequences of reality. Salary employees have no such liability, they go to work at 9am and leave at 5pm and while most want increased responsbility because that usually yields increased competition, most have no interest in taking true responsibility for the company's health.   As the sole principal of the company it is wholly his choice what direction and decisions to make for the company. I guarantee you his decision will not be based on vengence or grudge but rather weighing incentives to continue, and being an older gentlemen decide it's no longer worth it and retire.   I've personally see many smaller companies do this in the past 10 years. \"\"Why go through the stress? I've got cash. I'm going to sell or close the company and retire.\"\"\"",

Capitalism rewards the positive results of proper decision making in the market place as businesses generate enough profit to allow them to stay afloat and expand, while those businesses that do not follow through with proper decision making reap negative results, fail and eventually go out of business. These are irrefutable facts which govern how capitalism works, i.e. success is rewarded, failure is punished and both of these results serve as lessons for all others in the marketplace who dare to heed these lessons based offered up by success and failure which are to be found in a capitalist economy.   So if the current market conditions dictate that allowing workers more free time, increased perks, etc will increase productivity and lead to success then it is only rational and reasonable for businesses to attend to the needs of their employees.   However if the costs of these perks begin to spiral out of control and/or are no longer relevant or favorable in the marketplace then cost cutting measures are needed to ensure that businesses are able to secure their profits and stay afloat. Those who do not rein in or alleviate these cost issues in their businesses will quickly go under as these costs eat out their bottom line and competitors move in to under-cut them in the market place. Nevertheless attempting to place some sort of emotional or political reasoning and judgment as to how and why businesses act in regards to cost cutting measures without first taking into account the reality of the circumstances in which they must operate in, i.e. having to make a profit in order to survive, is unreasonable and flat out childish.\"",
