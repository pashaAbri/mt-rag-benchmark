Guidelines for required disclosure are as follows: 1) Individuals must disclose when their ownership exceeds 5%; 2) Non-individual legal entities (read: companies; e.g. a hedge fund) must disclose when their ownership exceeds 10% (Form 13-F); and 3) All Officers and Directors Notice the word \"\"required.\"\" For example, a entity (individual/company) may file \"\"confidentiality letter\"\" (which allows them to delay disclosing ownership) with the SEC as they are building a position.  So at any given point in time the information that is publicaly available may not be \"\"up-to-date.\"\" And in all cases beneficial owner(ship).\"",

    "original_text": "I apologize for the confusion. You are correct that Form 13F is another significant SEC filing. It requires institutional investment managers with investment discretion over $100 million or more in securities to report their long positions in equity securities four times a year. This information is useful for investors who want to track the investment activities of major financial institutions. However, it's important to note that Form 13F filings may not reflect an institution's complete holdings, as they only cover equity securities and have a $100 million reporting threshold."
