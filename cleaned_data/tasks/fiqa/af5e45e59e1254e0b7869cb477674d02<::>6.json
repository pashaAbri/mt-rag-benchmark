Guidelines for required disclosure are as follows: 1) Individuals must disclose when their ownership exceeds 5%; 2) Non-individual legal entities (read: companies; e.g. a hedge fund) must disclose when their ownership exceeds 10% (Form 13-F); and 3) All Officers and Directors Notice the word \"\"required.\"\" For example, a entity (individual/company) may file \"\"confidentiality letter\"\" (which allows them to delay disclosing ownership) with the SEC as they are building a position.  So at any given point in time the information that is publicaly available may not be \"\"up-to-date.\"\" And in all cases beneficial owner(ship).\"",
