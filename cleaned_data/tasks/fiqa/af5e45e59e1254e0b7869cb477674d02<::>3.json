  "gold_answer": "The SEC defines an accredited investor as a variety of entities, including financial institutions, employee benefit plans with over $5 million in assets, certain charitable organizations, and individuals meeting specific income or net worth thresholds. There are no citizenship or residency requirements to qualify.\nIf a company has more than 500 shareholders, it must register with the SEC as an Investment Company. This registration brings about public reporting and additional regulatory compliance. This often leads to the practical necessity of going public with an IPO, even if it's not a legal requirement.",
