  "gold_answer": "There are different ways to consider salary compensation besides the traditional gross salary. Total compensation includes salary and bonuses, as well as the cost or value of employer-paid healthcare, retirement, company cars, expense accounts, stock options, and other valuable goods or services. Additionally, the total employee cost is generally double the gross cash compensation (salary + bonuses) and includes employer-paid payroll taxes and practical costs like the cost of your computer, cubicle or office furniture, and the portion of utility costs that keep you well-lit, clean and comfortable. It's also important to consider the cost of living in the area where your employees live, as this can significantly impact the actual value of their salaries. For example, $100k in California may not go as far as $100k in other parts of the U.S. Finally, it's worth noting that salary pay does not directly translate to hourly wages, as salaried employees are compensated for a week of work, which may require more or less than 40 hours.",

      "text": "\n\"In the U.S., virtually all salaries are expressed as \"\"gross salaries\"\", which are before the taxes that the individual must pay on their income. The numbers shown in the links are almost certainly gross salary figures. However, the \"\"gross salary\"\" is not the entire \"\"total compensation\"\" number, which is the total value of all compensation and benefits that the employee receives for his work. Total compensation includes not only salary and bonuses, but the cost or value of any employer-paid healthcare, retirement, company car, expense account, stock options, and other valuable goods or services. That's still not the total amount of money the company has to pay to have you; there are employer-paid payroll taxes totaling 6.2% of your gross salary, plus practical costs like the cost of your computer, cubicle or office furniture, and the portion of utility costs that keep you well-lit, clean and comfortable. This complete number is called \"\"total employee cost\"\", and the general rule of thumb is that it's double your gross cash compensation (salary + bonuses). Lastly, $100k in California isn't worth as much, in real terms, as $100k in other parts of the U.S. The cost of living in California, especially in Silicon Valley where the majority of the people who make six figures by being C++ programmers are located, is ridiculously expensive. There are other tech hubs in the U.S., like DFW, Austin TX, Atlanta GA, St Louis MO, Raleigh NC, etc where people earn less, but also spend less to live and so can use more of their salary in a \"\"discretionary\"\" manner.\"",
