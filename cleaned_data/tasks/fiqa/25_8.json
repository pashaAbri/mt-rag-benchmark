  "gold_answer": "A financial advisor is a professional service provider who can handle tasks that you either don't have time for or prefer someone else to manage. If you lack the time or interest to manage your investments, hiring a financial advisor is a good idea. It's generally better to work with an advisor who charges an annual fee based on a percentage of your account value rather than one who gets paid based on transactions. Advisors compensated in the latter way may have a vested interest in making frequent changes to your account, which might not be in your best interest. It's important to be cautious of advisors who promote expensive mutual funds with sales loads or annuities. Additionally, your advisor's compensation structure should be transparent.",

It is his/her job to do things for you that you could do for yourself, but you're either too busy to do it yourself (and you want to pay somebody else), or you'd rather not. Just like some people hire tax preparers, or maids, or people to change their oil, or re-roof their houses. Me, I choose to self-manage.  I get some advise from Fidelity and Vanguard.
