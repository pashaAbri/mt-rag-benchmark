  "gold_answer": "If you receive dividends on an investment, those are taxed. When you exchange investments for cash, you will have to pay tax on that, disregarding capital losses, capital loss carryovers, AGI thresholds, and other special rules. For most investments, you get taxed on any gain in value in the investment or dividends paid by that investment. Usually, you don't take the tax hit until you sell the investment and realize the gain, with some exceptions for mutual funds. For bonds, CDs, and other cash-type investments, you have to pay taxes in the year they pay out the interest or dividend.\n1) You can put money (up to a certain limit) in a traditional IRA and can subtract that amount from your income for tax calculation for the year you invest it. However, you are going to pay taxes on it when you take the money out at retirement. It really just delays the taxes.\n2) If you put the money in a Roth IRA, you don't get a tax break now, but you don't have to pay any taxes on the money or the gains when you take it out at retirement.\n3) The gains from some mutual funds can be tax exempt, but that just saves you from paying tax on the increase in value.\n4) Don't fall for scams that try to use insurance policies as investments to avoid taxes. The fees are enormous, which usually makes them a rip-off.",
