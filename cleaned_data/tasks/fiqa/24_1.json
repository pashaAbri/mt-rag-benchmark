  "gold_answer": "The decision between these two options may depend on your financial situation and your goals regarding your credit score and debt. If your goal is to improve your credit score, you might consider paying it on a monthly basis to benefit from positive effects of no late payments and long term accounts. If your goal is to minimize interest payments, you might consider paying off the loan entirely. Additionally, if you got a very low APR for your car loan, then you might want to consider investing instead of loan payment because you could earn more than the interest you pay.",

      "text": "\nI used to work for Ally Auto (formerly known as GMAC) and I'd advise not to pay off the account unless you need to free up some debt in your credit report since until the account is paid off it will show that you owe your financial institution the original loan amount. The reason why I am saying not to pay-off the account is because good/bad payments are sent to the credit bureau 30 days after the due date of the payment, and if you want to increase your credit score then its best to pay it on a monthly basis, the negative side to this is you will pay more interest by doing this.  If ever you decide to leave $1.00 in loan, I am pretty much sure that the financial institution will absorb the remaining balance and consider the account paid off.  What exactly is your goal here? Do you plan to increase your credit score? Do you need to free up some debt?",

The loan will appear on your credit for 7 years but the bump to your score will be reduced more after 2 years if you pay it off in less than 12 months.   If you would have several payment left after you have the ability to pay it off then just pay it off.  The reduction is not severe or worth the price of interest unless you have <1%. Unused credit has an attrition factor.  If you continue to use your credit in a healthy way (>0 <20% balance, no late payments, long term accounts) then you should not even realize much of a negative change.",
