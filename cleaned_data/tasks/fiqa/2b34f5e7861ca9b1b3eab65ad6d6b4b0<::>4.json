It does not depend primarily upon oil exports like other countries, but rather on very complex machinery and other finished products.  Additionally Germany currently are in control of al lot of countries debts (especially Ireland) which means that they will become the main players in decisions regarding the proliferation/faltering of the European economy in the future.",

Greece has already technically defaulted by saying it's not going to pay back all of it's debt.  They will officially default when Germany stops bailing them out.  Spain is in the exact same situation, just about a year behind.  They haven't technically defaulted yet, but they will.  They're receiving bailout after bailout and the Greece situation only makes their interest rates worse.  Italy is just barely behind Spain, the Greek default followed by the Spanish defualt will send Italian interest rates through the roof dooming them to the same fate.  This will eventually effect the US, but our borrowing rates are held artificially low due to the Fed just printing up more fake money and letting the US borrow as much as it wants.  If you don't see this scheme crumbling and collapsing, I'm just curious what you actually think *will* happen?",

IMO, Germany hit it right on the head. Low corporate tax rates with high personal tax rates. This maintains a very business friendly environment (business move there because of the skilled labor and low corporate taxes), but they effectively pass the burden on to individuals (who also benefit from the pro-business environment). You'd be hard pressed to find an economist that doesn't think Germany's economy has been very strong over the past decade (very good Soros speech that was recently posted about his analysis of the Euro and Germany's unfair benefits, but that's a whole different gear). What I find the issue to be is the whole concept is complex enough that's difficult to explain to the average person with a 2 second attention span. That's why I like writing posts like this, to try to help people understand how finance and businesses operate behind the scenes!\"",

They are bleeding so many jobs to China  and south east Asia experts are predicting they won't have any manufacturing sector jobs left within the year. This is going to exacerbate Germany's already sky high unemployment rate and god knows how they are going to pay off their enormous national debt.  On another point I just don't understand how we allow police and fire unions as they don't make those jobs any safer and just end up costing the tax payers more money. If it weren't for them we could pay our police and fire fighters minimum wages. That would equate to about a hundred dollars in tax savings for each and every property owner in a municipality.  Furthermore the rights of the workers are best represented by their employers and not an expensive, corrupt union. You can clearly see the efficiency with which large employers like Flour Daniels takes care of their non-union employees. Sure the non-union people have a much higher medical debt load, less home ownership and more frequent bankruptcies due to unpaid medical debt but that is not without its advantages.",
