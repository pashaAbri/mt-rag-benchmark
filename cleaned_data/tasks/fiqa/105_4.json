These filings are available to the public at www.sec.gov on the Edgar database. There are various types of filings, some specific to publicly traded companies and others applicable to registered corporations in general.

US-based companies are obligated to adhere to the regulations mandated by the US government, which are supervised by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC's EDGAR system contains all the necessary reports. Additionally, the second document affirms this requirement, stating that both foreign and domestic companies must electronically submit registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms to the SEC's EDGAR database. Therefore, US-based companies must comply with the SEC's requirements.\n\n|user|: What are the requirements? \n|assistant|: The SEC defines an accredited investor as a variety of entities, including financial institutions, employee benefit plans with over $5 million in assets, certain charitable organizations, and individuals meeting specific income or net worth thresholds. There are no citizenship or residency requirements to qualify.\nIf a company has more than 500 shareholders, it must register with the SEC as an Investment Company. This registration brings about public reporting and additional regulatory compliance. This often leads to the practical necessity of going public with an IPO, even if it's not a legal requirement.\n|user|: What is the filing requirement for them?"

For instance, Eagleline is listed as potentially IPOing next week. You can find out all the details of any IPO including correspondence between the company and the SEC on Edgar. Here's the link for Eagleline (disclaimer, I have not investigated this company. It is an example only)  https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?action=getcompany&CIK=0001675776&owner=exclude&count=40 The most important, complex, and thorough document is the initial registration statement, usually an S-1, and subsequent amendments that occur as a result of new information or SEC questions. You can often get insight into a new public company by looking at the changes that have occurred in amendments since their initial filings. I highly advise people starting out to first look at the filings of companies they work for or know the industry intimately. This will help you to better understand the filings from companies you may not be so familiar with.  A word of caution. Markets and company filings are followed by very large numbers of smart people experienced in each business area so don't assume there is fast and easy money to be made. Still, you will be a bit ahead if you learn to read and understand the filings public companies are required to make.",
