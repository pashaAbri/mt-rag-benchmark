  "gold_answer": "Every situation is unique, but it's about evaluating the company's objectives. People often mention WACC, but in truth, it's less crucial than determining the amount of debt a company can handle, which is determined by leverage and solvency statistics. WACC is a pricing model and isn't related to risk modeling.",

People always talk about WACC, but in reality, WACC is less important than figuring how how much debt a Company can support (determined by leverage and solvency statistics).  Here are a few things to think about:  -How stable are the Company's cash flows? (big difference between a Company that has multi-year contracts locked in place vs. variable/cyclical revenue streams; what type of Capex requirement is there?)  -What is the purpose of raising the capital? (growth vs. recapitalization; where are the proceeds going?)  -What collateral is available for creditors?  -What does working capital look like? (is there seasonality?)",
