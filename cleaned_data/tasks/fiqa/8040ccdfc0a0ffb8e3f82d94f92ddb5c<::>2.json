The bank can not treat that money as a deposit and thus leverage it make money them selves. You can open an account and get a debit card.

When you make a purchase with a credit card, you're essentially borrowing money from the bank, which you then pay back later. This loan comes with interest charges, unless you pay your balance in full each month.\nAdditionally, as mentioned in the documents, there can be differences in how merchants handle debit and credit cards, and there can be advantages to having both types of cards for backup in case of issues with the other."
