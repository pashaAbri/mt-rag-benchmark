  "input": "Is a home a good investment?",
  "gold_answer": "A home is the first and best investment where you build a life, but the value it returns isn't primarily.  It's not like a stock or bond that you hold for a little while and then cash out for the profit.  You can own a home with as little as 3% down and as you pay for your living you pay it off.   Others argue that it is not a good investment because it is a single, indivisible, undiversified, and illiquid asset, and its value is tied to the local economy, which can lead to losses during a recession and housing bust. It is an expense/liability/asset. Therefore, whether a home is a good investment or not depends on various factors and individual financial goals.",

      "text": "\nApplying for a mortgage is a bit of paperwork, but not too bad of an experience. Rates are pretty tight, if one lender were more that 1/4% lower than another, they'd be inundated with applications. Above a certain credit score, you get the 'best' rate, a search will show you the rates offered in your area.  If you are a first time buyer, there are mortgages that might benefit you. If you are a vet (for non-native English readers, a veteran who served in the US armed forces, not a veterinarian, who is an animal doctor) there are mortgages that offer low-to-no down payment with attractive rates.  Yes, avoid PMI, it's a crazy penalty on your overall expense of home purchase. If banks qualify you for different amounts, it shouldn't be a huge difference, a few percent variation. But, the standard ratios are pretty liberal even today, and getting the most you'd qualify for is probably too much.  Using the standard 28/36% ratios, a bank will qualify you for 4X your income as a loan. e.g you make $50K, they'll lend you $200K. This is a bit too much in my opinion.  If you come up short, you are really looking to borrow too much, and should probably wait. If you owe a bit on loans, it should squeeze in between those two ratios, 28/36. But I wouldn't borrow on a credit line to add to the purchase, that's asking for trouble.",

                "model_text": "|user|: My friend wants to put my name down for a house he's buying. What risks would I be taking?\n|assistant|: There are several risks you might be taking if your friend puts your name down for a house he's buying.  Firstly, if you are co-signing the mortgage, the risk is that you will owe the bank the principal amount of the mortgage if your friend is unable to pay. You could come out of it a lot poorer and with your credit rating wrecked. Secondly, if you are not on the deed of the house, you would not have any legal rights to the property. This means that your friend could sell the house without your consent and you would still be responsible for the mortgage.  Thirdly, if your friend's house is a second home, he may not qualify for mortgage assistance or relief, increasing the risk for you as a co-signer.    Lastly, anyone considering this approach to talk to a lawyer and be aware of the potential tax implications.  \n|user|: Does being a veteran help to get a mortgage?\n|assistant|: Yes, being a veteran can help to get a mortgage. There are mortgages available specifically for veterans, such as VA loans, which offer low-to-no down payment and attractive rates. However, in a seller's market, buyers with VA loans may face challenges as some sellers might prefer offers with fewer barriers. Have you looked at conventional financing rather than VA? VA loans are not always a great deal. Conventional tends to be the best, and FHA being better than VA. It is also important to note that veterans can  make themselves more appealing to sellers with non-VA loans.\n|user|: Benefits of FHA loan?\n|assistant|: FHA is an insurance policy to the bank saying that if you default they will cover a high percentage of the loan. An FHA loan has several benefits. Firstly, it only requires a 3.5% down payment and allows for lower credit scores compared to traditional mortgages. This makes it a viable option for first-time homebuyers or those with limited credit history. Secondly, the PMI costs associated with FHA loans can be reduced by the size of the down payment. However, it's important to note that FHA loans require mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) for the life of the loan, which can increase the overall cost of the mortgage.\n|user|: Do I need a real estate agent?\n|assistant|: Whether or not you need a real estate agent depends on your individual needs and circumstances. In the United States, the seller typically pays the real estate agent fee. If you don't have an agent, you may miss out on their expertise in explaining contract terms, advising you on making offers, the option to do inspections. While you can technically complete a real estate transaction without an agent, it's strongly advised to have one to guide you through the process and help you avoid potential pitfalls.\n|user|: How to become a real estate agent and does it pay?\n|assistant|: To become a real estate agent, you would typically need to take a pre-licensing course from a certified provider within your state, pass a licensing exam, and then complete a certain number of hours of post-licensing education. As for whether it pays, real estate agents typically make a commission of 3% to 3.5% of the sale price of a property, which can vary depending on the location and the sale price. However, earnings can be unpredictable and depend on various factors such as the number of transactions and the sale prices of the properties. And they only get paid if the house sells.\n|user|: Buying vs renting a home.\n|assistant|: The decision between buying and renting a home is a complex one that depends mostly on what makes economic sense. Pros of buying: - Building equity: When you buy a home, some of your monthly payment goes towards building equity in the property. - Tax benefits: Mortgage interest and property taxes are tax-deductible. - Freedom to customize: When you own a home, you have the freedom to customize it to your liking. - Stability: Owning a home can provide a sense of stability and security. Cons of buying: - Upfront costs: Buying a home typically requires a significant down payment and closing costs. - Maintenance and repairs: Homeowners are responsible for maintenance and repairs. A lot depends on how much of that you do yourself - Lack of mobility: buying only makes sense if you stay in the house for 5 years or more. Pros of renting: Rent. If you have no idea whether you will still be in the same part of the country five years from now - Lower upfront costs: Renting typically requires less upfront costs compared to buying. - No responsibility for maintenance and repairs. Cons of renting: - No equity building. - Rent increases: Rents can increase over time. - Limited customization: Renters typically have limited ability to customize their living space. Consider your individual needs, circumstances, and financial situation when making the decision between buying and renting.\n|user|: Is a home a good investment?"

      "text": "\nOmg, the answer is easy. Tell the TRUTH, and nothing is fraud. Down payment gifts are SOP's, and every lender works with that. EACH lender has their own rules. Fannie May and Freddie Mac could care less, and FHA and VA backed loans allow for full gifting unless the buyer's credit is below the standard 620, then 3.5% must come from the buyer. Standard bank loans want to know the source of the down payment for ONE REASON ONLY: to know if the buyer is taking ON A NEW DEBT! The only thing you will need do is sign a legal document stating the entire down payment is a gift.  That way the bank knows their lendee isn't owing a new substantial debt, and that there aren't two lenders on the house, because should she default, the bank will have to pay you back first off the resale. Get it? They just want to know how many hands are in the fire.",

Once you get below 20% loan to value, you can petition the mortgage company to remove the PMI (with conventional loans; VA and FHA have lifetime PMI). If it was me, I'd do one of two things.  Both involve paying off the student loan now.  The savings from the student loan payment will assist you in helping you meet one of the two goals below.  Also both involve getting a 15 year fixed. The first would be to buy the house now, and work like crazy to get rid of the PMI.  My goal would be to get rid of this within 18 months.   The second would be to save up enough cash for the 20% down and then buy the house.  You'd miss out on the house you are looking at, which is kind of heartbreaking.  Who is to say that a better home does not come along at the same price?  My goal would be to have the downpayment in 9 months, and really try to have it in 6 months. Being an old guy that has experience how much of a virtue patience is, I'd recommend the second option.",

Owning housing as an investment property is a horrible idea, and anyone who does it, especially right now with as bubbly as the market is looking again, (or, better put, still, since the last bubble never did fully pop and clear out the underlying systemic instability,) is an idiot. And even after the current housing market bubble pops, it's likely to remain a bad idea for decades.  We're never getting the early 2000s back, for basic supply-and-demand reasons: with the Baby Boom generation retiring, aging and dying off, they're not likely to do much more home-buying, and no generation after them is as big as they are, which means a glut of oversupply and weak demand for the entirety of the foreseeable future.\"",

This gives it different characteristics than other investments (e.g. increasing the amount invested by buying a more expensive home doesn't do much to assist your financial well-being and future income, and isn't necessarily the \"\"responsible\"\" thing to do). You may get some capital gains, typically in line with inflation, sometimes less, sometimes more, but those aren't the most reliable, and it's difficult to realize them (it involves selling your house and moving). Its main value as a hedge is a hedge against rising rent. But if you're still working full-time and can expect cost-of-living increases, that hedge may not be as valuable to you as it would to, say, someone living on a fixed income. But as for treating it as a \"\"low-risk investment\"\"? That's very problematic. Real low-risk investments are things like government bonds, where you can't lose principal. Unless you're going to live into your house until the day you die, the real estate crash should have disabused you of any notion that housing values never go down. Rather, your house is a single, indivisible, undiversified, illiquid investment. Imagine, if you will, going to your brokerage and borrowing a hundred thousand dollars or more on margin to invest in a single real estate investment trust... then take away whatever diversification the trust offered by holding multiple properties. Also, you can't sell any of it until you move away, and the transaction fee will take something like 3%. Still sound \"\"safe\"\"? Moreover, it's exactly the wrong kind of risk. Your house's value is tied to what people are willing to pay for housing where your house is, which is usually subject to the whims of the local economy. This means that in a recession and housing bust in the local economy, you can lose your job and have your mortgage go underwater at the same time. It totally makes sense to treat your house as an investment to some extent, and it makes double sense for a financial adviser to consider it as part of your investment recommendations. \"\"Safety\"\" is not the way you should be thinking of it, though.\"",
