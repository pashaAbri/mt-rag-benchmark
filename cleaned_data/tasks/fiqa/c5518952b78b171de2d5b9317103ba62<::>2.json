You can use current account for daily spending and re-investing your business, and you can have another account for your savings. You should be careful so that not to mix personal and business expenses.\n|user|: Is it free to open a second bank account?"

Other banks have a token \"\"just in case I move\"\" amount of money. The only cost is that you have to check them from time to time to make sure each account has enough for its likely uses.  I use mint.com for that.\"",

Generally, you can find one that will offer \"\"free\"\" checking in exchange for direct deposit or a minimum balance. Some are totally free, but those banks pay zippo for interest. If you don't care about location, I would look at Charles Schwab Bank. I've been using them for a couple of years and have been really satisfied with them. They provide free checking, ATM fee reimbursement, free checks and pre-paid deposit envelopes. You also can easily move money between Schwab brokerage or savings accounts. Other brokers offer similar services as well.\"",
