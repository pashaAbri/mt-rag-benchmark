I was tempted by it myself, gee, almost 20 years ago.  I still own some of the stock.  But I held mutual funds first. There are two disadvantages that have disuaded me from partaking in the ESPP of my subsequent employers (one of which was a spin-out company of the stock-issuing company, the other having bought the spin-out).  First, putting a bunch of money in a single stock is rather risky.  single stocks will drop dramatically due to market conditions.  Generally market conditions don't act so dramatically on all stock.  Second, is it wise to put not only your salary but also your saved wealth all in one basket? It worked out reasonably well for me.  The stock doubled right before my division was spun out -- I sold half of my position.    And the resulting stock has continued to provide opportunities to diversify.  However, it could have just as easily dropped in half instead of doubled. What is your timeline for holding the stock -- for realizing any gain?  Can you afford patience if the stock value should drop in half? I have co-workers who continue to invest through our new company's ESPP.  At least one co-worker has the stated goal to sell after every purchase -- he holds the stock long enough to make a long-term gain instead of short term, but he sells after every purchase.  And it seems to him that the stock always drops right when he wants to sell.",

    "original_text": "Based on the documents provided, here are some pros and cons of buying discounted company stock:\nPros:\n1. Potential for higher returns: With a discounted stock purchase plan, you can buy shares at a lower price, which can lead to higher returns if the stock price increases.\n2. Selling in-the-money covered calls: If you can buy discounted company stock, you have the opportunity to sell in-the-money covered calls and potentially make more than you would selling at strike.\nCons:\n1. Risk of job loss: If the company that provides your income experiences difficulties, there is a risk that you may lose your job and also see your investments in the company's stock decrease in value.\n2. Concentration risk: Putting a large portion of your savings in a single stock can be risky, as the value of that stock may fluctuate significantly due to market conditions or company-specific events.\n3. Short-term volatility: Even if you plan to hold the stock for the long term, there may be short-term volatility that could affect your ability to sell at a desired price.\nIt's important to consider your own financial goals and risk tolerance before making a decision to invest in discounted company stock."
