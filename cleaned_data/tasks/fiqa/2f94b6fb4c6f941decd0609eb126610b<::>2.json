  "gold_answer": "401(k) contributions are pre-tax dollars. A 401k account is taxed when you withdraw the money upon retirement. This is similar to how an IRA is taxed. The idea behind this is that you will likely be in a lower tax bracket at the time of retirement. It's important to note that 401k contributions reduce your taxable income for each paycheck, but they do not impact the level of your social security and medicare taxes. Also, the employer match is considered free money.",

That may not necessarily be the case though, in which case a Roth IRA would be a better option because you're paying for it with after tax dollars and distributions are untaxed. If you wanted to hedge your bets you could have both an IRA/401k and a Roth IRA.  An IRA has income limits above which the contributions are no longer tax deductible, I don't believe a 401k has the same limitations (for completion's sake: a Roth IRA has income limits above which you can't contribute to one).

      "text": "\nThe amount you contribute will reduce the taxable income for each paycheck, but it won't impact the level of your social security and medicare taxes. A 401(k) plan is a qualified deferred compensation plan in which an   employee can elect to have the employer contribute a portion of his or   her cash wages to the plan on a pretax basis. Generally, these   deferred wages (commonly referred to as elective contributions) are   not subject to income tax withholding at the time of deferral, and   they are not reflected on your Form 1040 (PDF) since they were not   included in the taxable wages on your Form W-2 (PDF). However, they   are included as wages subject to withholding for social security and   Medicare taxes. In addition, employers must report the elective   contributions as wages subject to federal unemployment taxes. You might be able to keep this up for more than 7 weeks if the company offers health, dental and vision insurance. Your contributions for these policies would need to be paid for before you contribute to the 401K. Of course these items are also pre-tax so they will keep the taxable amount at zero. If there was a non-pretax deduction on your pay check that would keep the check at zero, but there would be taxes owed. This might be union dues, but it can also be some life and disability insurance polices. Most stubs specify which deductions are pre-tax, and which are post-tax. Warning. If you get the company match some companies give you the maximum match for those 7 weeks, then zero for the rest of the year. Others will still credit you with a match at the end of the year saying if you should get the benefit. It is not required that they do this. Check the company documents. You could also contribute post-tax money, which is different than Roth 401K, for the rest of the year to keep the match going. Note: If you are turning 50 this year, or are already 50, then you can contribute an additional $5,500",
