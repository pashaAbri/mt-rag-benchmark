  "gold_answer": "There are some tax-deductible options related to charitable activities. However, it's important to clarify that you cannot deduct the value of your time or services, including the income lost while working as an unpaid volunteer for a qualified organization. This includes charitable donations of time or services. However, you can deduct actual costs associated with volunteering, such as expenses for equipment, supplies, or wages paid to employees or contractors for work related to the charity. If you have donated items like a published book that you authored (not specifically written for the organization), you might be able to deduct its fair market value. In summary, while you cannot directly deduct the value of your time or services, you can deduct certain expenses related to charitable activities, which may help lower your tax burden.  In fact, tax deductions allow you to give to charities from your gross salary, not your net salary. The Charitable donations can be deducted from your income, and in that way make your taxable income lower, hence lower taxes. ",

Some common sense would show that if you could deduct something that didn't cost you anything (your time) you could deduct away all of your income and avoid paying taxes altogether. Back to your more nuanced question could 2 businesses you own bill each other for services? Yes, but you will still have to pay taxes for money earned under each of them. You will also need to be careful that the IRS does not construe the transactions as being done solely to lower your tax bill.",

      "text": "\n\"Charitable donations can be deducted from your income, and in that way make your taxable income lower, hence lower taxes. That's the meaning of \"\"tax deductible\"\". As to \"\"if I donate it then the money will be given right to the charity instead of spread out to many other places\"\" - taxes are being used by the government based on its own decisions (presumably made by elected officials thus representing the will of the voters). Charities use the money based on their defined goals. Giving money to a charity will ensure it is used for the specific goal the charity declared, and that's the way for you to funnel money to the goals of your preference/choice. For example, you can donate money to your temple, orphanage around the corner, or the gay rights organization. Or anti gay, for that matters. Your money will be spent on the goals of your choosing. Re advantages - charitable donations are used by the rich folks to avoid paying taxes on their income (because they're deductible), so someone might donate money to places they use themselves (like the temple/church for example, or the school where the kids go, or politician which will \"\"objectively\"\" choose someone's business for a big government contract, etc etc). For \"\"ordinary\"\" people it's a way to reduce the taxable income and divert the money to the specific goals of their choice. For example, donating $100 to Red Cross Japan Tsunami relief fund, will reduce your taxable income by $100, and total taxes by $28 (assuming you're in the 28% bracket), thus the $28 will go to the specific goal your choose instead of the general taxes.\"",
