  "input": "I mean current EV's battery does not stand for a used car market...how do you think?",
  "gold_answer": "The longevity of EV batteries can indeed impact the used car market. The companies like Toyota and GM have done extensive testing and research to ensure the longevity of their battery packs. For instance, Toyota's battery packs have proven to last longer than initially claimed, debunking the notion that they would need replacement every five years. Similarly, GM has made similar claims about the longevity of their packs. However, Nissan's decision to omit a liquid cooling system in their cars' battery packs has led to heat-related issues, affecting their longevity.  Enhanced battery tech investment needed badly, but not anytime soon while batteries are not the only bottleneck in vehicle production.",

People are working on fast charging and long life battery tech too.  And there are a number of flow battery technologies, where the electrolytes are like fuel, and the power extraction unit is like an engine. These may never be suitable for vehicles, but they can store huge amounts of energy for months.   Also there are some very high energy density batteries that are non-rechargeable but where the solid electrolytes are replaceable and recyclable. These have energy density close to that of gasoline.",

This is an amount you cannot buy anywhere. Not even if you're Mercedes or BMW or GM. The only solution is to build dedicated factories for this, and that takes 3-5 years.  Tesla has the forethought to realize this is the bottleneck and they moved early. So in 2020 each of the other car makers can maybe source enough batteries for 100K cars/year, while Tesla will make their own to the tune of 1M cars/year.  This will change eventually, of course.

My point was that Toyota, didn't base their longevity claims on nothing; they did a shitload of testing of their battery before putting it out, and the \"\"you'll need a new pack after five years\"\" crowd was ultimately proved wrong.  GM has made similar claims about the longevity of their packs, based on similar shitloads of research and testing, and I see no reason why they won't ultimately enjoy the same vindication.  As for Nissan, they are reaping the effects of cheaping out and omitting a liquid cooling system from their cars battery packs. Heat kills batteries of any chemistry!\"",
