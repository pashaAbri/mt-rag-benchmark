  "gold_answer": "That's correct. The longevity of EV batteries is an important factor in the used car market.   Compare to a gasoline car, the gas savings alone will be cheaper let alone repairs, oil change, filters, and it is already at 35k while EV is down to 25K.   Only the negative factor is an EV's battery impacting its resale value. ",

I wouldn't be surprising to see EVs take a significant share of the auto market in the coming years (they were ~1% in 2016).  Innovation drives economic growth.  It's also good for the environment (the electricity used is much cleaner than gasoline/diesel) and electrical grid (increased demand that's potentially responsive to system load helps finance smart grid improvements).",
