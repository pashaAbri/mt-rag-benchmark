The names of lottery winners are public, so this advantage would not mean much to you. Swiss banks are generally very large, secure, and capable of handling large amounts of money, however, so if Switzerland isn't too inconvenient for you, it's worth considering.  You won't want to keep all of it in a bank account for long; the majority of it should be invested. It would definitely be worth paying for a trusted financial advisor to guide you through that.  Avoid the urge to swim in a pile of gold coins.",

Personal experience, I'm a current undergraduate and while Capital One ATMs are everywhere and while account fees do not exist while I work, my normal Capital One bank account would be shut down, every time, over the summer. Why? Because I didn't work over the summer and I couldn't keep the minimum balance in my account. With a 360 account, I don't have to worry about paper working being mailed home when I need it at my dorm (or vice versa) and I don't have to worry about minimum balance fees closing my account (it doesn't screw my credit when that happens, but I have to open up a NEW account; frustrating). The advantages of a 360 account is that it's all online, there are no minimum balance requirements, and that I can easily access it online and even deposit checks with the Capital One app.",

        "text": "\n\"A checking account almost never earns any significant interest. A checking accounts often does not have any limits in terms of how many times you can draw funds from it. A checking account often comes with a debit card allowing you to pay online, draw cash from an ATM machine etc. A savings accounts has much higher yields, so you should be getting a decent interest. Unfortunately in the current climate this is not always true (especially not with the big banks) so you may want to look into a high-yield savings account. A savings account is often limited in terms of number of transactions, meaning you can't constantly draw funds from it, it must be stable. A savings account often does not come with a debit card. No, a savings account should not be used for regular transactions. It's an account to park your money for a medium/long time. Understand that banks loan out the money in your savings account to third-parties, so if it would constantly fluctuate, they can't have this money available to others. In return of you parking your money with your bank, you should get a nice return (interest). Yes, but it's not common. Assuming you are from USA, passing banking data (account number and routing number) to third-parties is not safe. In Europe it's totally safe to share your account number to accept money. Depends, some banks do charge fees, some don't. Often there are fees when you're not using the account (no transactions), or when you don't have a certain minimum in an account. Assuming you are American (please specify this information clearly in future) I would look into an \"\"internet bank\"\", like Ally. They don't have many fees and they have an excellent high-yield savings account. They also give you a debit card. Disadvantage is that they don't have physical branches.\"",

They don't have many fees and offer a high-yield savings account, which could be beneficial for a second account. They also provide a debit card. However, they don't have physical branches. Another option could be Charles Schwab Bank, which provides free checking if you don't mind about the location. If you prefer a traditional bank, you could consider opening a second account with a different bank from the one you currently use. This could provide you with more options for products like mortgages or credit extensions, as you wouldn't be limited to just one institution."
