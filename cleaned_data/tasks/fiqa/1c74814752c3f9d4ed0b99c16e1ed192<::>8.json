  "gold_answer": "No. Personal income tax rates and rules differ from state to state in the USA. Seven U.S. states currently don't have an income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming; some only tax income derived in the state, and some tax worldwide income (like New York or California), similarly to the Federal income taxes. However, suppose you're living abroad (i.e., you're a citizen or resident of a foreign country and live there). In that case, you're not considered a resident by most states (check with your state for specific definitions) for most, if not all, the time of your residency abroad. In such a case, you don't pay state taxes; you only pay federal taxes.  You have to remember that foreign income exclusion doesn't apply to the income from your 401k, so you pay the taxes as if you're in the US.",

So to be clear, you were talking about just income tax in your original comment? Or do those states have no other forms of tax whatsoever? I am still confused because you just said \"\"state tax\"\" in your original comment and did not specify a specific type of taxation like \"\"income tax\"\" or \"\"property tax\"\" or \"\"business tax\"\" or \"\"sales tax\"\" within the state.\"",

In such case - you don't pay state taxes, only Federal. You have to remember that foreign income exclusion doesn't apply to the income from your 401k, so you pay the taxes as if you're in the US. You can not use foreign taxes credit as well (but depending on the tax treaty with the country you're moving to, your 401k income might not be taxable there). In some cases you may end up with double taxation: US will tax your 401k income as you're a US citizen and the income is derived from the US sources, and the foreign country will tax the income based on its own laws. This is not a tax advice, and this answer was not intended or written to be used, and it cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding penalties that may be imposed on the taxpayer.",
