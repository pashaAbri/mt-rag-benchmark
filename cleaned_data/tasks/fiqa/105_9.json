Securities are defined as (1) The term \u201csecurity\u201d means any note, stock, treasury stock,   security future, security-based swap, bond, debenture, evidence of   indebtedness, certificate of interest or participation in any   profit-sharing agreement, collateral-trust certificate,   preorganization certificate or subscription, transferable share,   investment contract, voting-trust certificate, certificate of deposit   for a security, fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other   mineral rights, any put, call, straddle, option, or privilege on any   security, certificate of deposit, or group or index of securities   (including any interest therein or based on the value thereof), or any   put, call, straddle, option, or privilege entered into on a national   securities exchange relating to foreign currency, or, in general, any   interest or instrument commonly known as a \u201csecurity\u201d, or any   certificate of interest or participation in, temporary or interim   certificate for, receipt for, guarantee of, or warrant or right to   subscribe to or purchase, any of the foregoing. thus currencies are not defined as securities. While OTC transactions of securities is not outright forbidden, there are numerous regulations issued by the SEC as a result of the 1943 Exchange Act and others that make this difficult and/or costly. Many other securities are exempted from registration thus trade in a way that could be called OTC. Different countries have variances upon US law but are very similar. Any security could be traded OTC, but law prohibits it expressly or in such a way to make it relatively expensive; further, stock options are so tightly regulated that expiration dates, expiration intervals, strike intervals, and minimum ticks are all set by the authorities.",
