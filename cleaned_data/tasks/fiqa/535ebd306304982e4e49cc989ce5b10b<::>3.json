With a 0% interest rate, you can effectively borrow money from the dealership without paying any interest, which can make your payments lower and more manageable.  This can be beneficial if you want to preserve your savings by not paying the full price of the car upfront.  However, zero percent interest may sound great,  those deals often have extra margin built into the price to make up for it. There might also be late payment fees, prepayment penalties, and other clauses.  Also, these tend to be shorter 12 months vs  72 months. ",

        "text": "\nVery good answers as to how 0% loans are typically done.  In addition, many are either tied to a specific large item purchase, or credit cards with a no interest period.  On credit card transactions the bank is getting a fee from the retailer, who in turn is giving you a hidden charge to cover that fee.  In the case of a large purchase item like a car, the retailer is again quite likely paying a fee to cover what would be that interest, something they are willing to do to make the sale.  They will typically be less prone to deal as low a price in negotiation if you were not making that deal, or at times they may offer either a rebate or special low to zero finance rates, but you don't get both.",

        "text": "\nThe car deal makes money 3 ways. If you pay in one lump payment. If the payment is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, they make a profit. They loan you the money. You make payments over months or years, if the total amount you pay is greater than what they paid for the car, plus their expenses, plus their finance expenses they make money. Of course the money takes years to come in, or they sell your loan to another business to get the money faster but in a smaller amount. You trade in a car and they sell it at a profit. Of course that new transaction could be a lump sum or a loan on the used car... They or course make money if you bring the car back for maintenance, or you buy lots of expensive dealer options. Some dealers wave two deals in front of you: get a 0% interest loan. These tend to be shorter 12 months vs 36,48,60 or even 72 months. The shorter length makes it harder for many to afford. If you can't swing the 12 large payments they offer you at x% loan for y years that keeps the payments in your budget. pay cash and get a rebate. If you take the rebate you can't get the 0% loan. If you take the 0% loan you can't get the rebate. The price you negotiate minus the rebate is enough to make a profit. The key is not letting them know which offer you are interested in. Don't even mention a trade in until the price of the new car has been finalized. Otherwise they will adjust the price, rebate, interest rate, length of loan,  and trade-in value to maximize their profit. The suggestion of running the numbers through a spreadsheet is a good one. If you get a loan for 2% from your bank/credit union for 3 years and the rebate from the dealer, it will cost less in total than the 0% loan from the dealer. The key is to get the loan approved by the bank/credit union before meeting with the dealer. The money from the bank looks like cash to the dealer.",

Individual borrowers might be able to get away with \"\"free money\"\", but the bank does not look to make money on each loan, they look to make money on thousands of loans overall. For a retailer (including new car sellers). the actual financing costs will be baked into the sales price.  They will add, say, 10% to the sales price in exchange for an interest-free loan. They can also sell these loans to an investment bank or other entity, but they would be sold at a deep discount, so the difference will be made up in the sales price or other \"\"fees\"\". It's possible that they would just chalk it up to promotional discounts or customer acquisition costs, but it would not be a good practice on a large scale.\"",

    "original_text": "A 0% interest rate offer can provide some benefits of both paying in cash and financing. With a 0% interest rate, you can effectively borrow money from the dealership without paying any interest, which can make your payments lower and more manageable. This can be similar to financing with a low interest rate. At the same time, because you are not paying any interest, you will end up paying the same total price for the car as you would if you paid in cash, assuming you pay off the loan within the promotional period. This can be beneficial if you want to preserve your savings by not paying the full price of the car upfront. However, it's important to note that 0% interest rate offers are often only available to customers with excellent credit, so not everyone will qualify for these deals. Additionally, if you are unable to pay off the loan within the promotional period, you may be charged a higher interest rate or other penalties, so it's important to read the terms and conditions carefully before agreeing to a 0% interest rate offer."
