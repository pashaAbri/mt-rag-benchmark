You may also want to sell if the stock no longer aligns with your strategy if you have lost faith in the company or want to take out your initial investment to purchase something else. Additionally, it's advantageous to sell when there is high demand for the industry in which the business operates, such as during a boom like the dot-com bubble.",

In our case, it's because we're taking our principal out and buying something else.

That includes dividends -- we reduce the sell price a little with every dividend collected.",

    "original_text": "Selling a business can be motivated by various reasons. Business owners might choose to sell if they see a profitable opportunity, such as a lucrative offer from a potential buyer. Selling can also be an exit strategy for retiring owners or a way to cash out and distribute profits to shareholders. In some cases, selling may be necessary due to financial difficulties, intense competition, or changes in the market environment. Regardless of the motivation, selling a business involves careful planning, valuation, and negotiation to ensure a successful outcome."
