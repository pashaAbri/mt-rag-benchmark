  "gold_answer": "A limit order is a type of order where you set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell a security. The order will only be executed if the market price reaches the price you set. On the other hand, a market order is an order to buy or sell a security immediately at the best available current market price. Market orders do not guarantee a specific price, and the final execution price may be different from the price quoted at the time of order entry.\nThe choice between limit orders and market orders depends on your trading goals and risk tolerance.

      "text": "\n\"First of all, not all brokers allow trading during pre-market and post-market.  Some brokers only allow trading during the regular hours (9:30am - 4pm ET). Second of all, while you can place orders using limit orders and market orders during regular trading hours, you can only use limit orders during pre-market and post-market.  This is because the liquidity is much lower during pre-market and post-market, and using market orders could result in some trades filling at horrible prices.  So brokers don't allow using market orders outside of regular trading hours. Third, some brokers require you to specify that you want your order to be executed during pre-market or post-market.  For example, my broker allows me to specify either \"\"Day\"\" or \"\"Ext\"\" for my orders.  \"\"Day\"\" means I want my order to execute only during regular trading hours, and \"\"Ext\"\" means I want my order to execute at any time - pre-market, regular trading hours, or post-market. Finally, if your broker allows pre/post market trading, and you place a limit order while specifying \"\"Ext\"\", then your trade can happen in real-time during pre-market or post-market.  Per your example, if a stock is trading at $5 at 8am, and you put in a limit order (while specifying \"\"Ext\"\") to buy it at $5 at 8am, then your order will execute at that time and you will buy that stock at 8am.\"",

For example, pre-market hours are from 4:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on the NASDAQ stock market. During pre-market hours, you can place limit orders, but you cannot place market orders due to lower liquidity. This is because the volume and liquidity are generally much lower during pre-market hours compared to RTH. If an unexpected world event occurs, the volume and liquidity might increase. It is important to note that not all brokers allow pre-market trading, and if they do, you might need to specify that you want your order to be executed during pre-market hours.\n|user|: what are limit orders vs market orders?"

This can be especially dangerous in highly volatile stocks which have a significant spread between the bid and ask. That being said, you want to be very careful that you enter the price you intend into a limit order. It is better to be a bit slower at entering your orders than it is to make a terrible mistake like the one you mention in your question.",

      "text": "\nDifference between a limit and market order is largely a trade-off between price certainty and timing certainty. If you think the security is already well priced, the downside of a limit order is the price may never hit your limit and keep trading away from you. You'll either spend a lot of time amending your order or sitting around wishing you'd amended your order.  The downside of a market order is you don't know the execution price ahead of time. This is typically more of a issue with illiquid instruments where even smaller orders may have price impact. For small trades in more liquid securities your realized price will often resemble the last traded price. Hope that helps. Both have a purpose, and the best tool for the job will depend on your circumstances.",

      "text": "\nIn general stock markets are very similar to that, however, you can also put in limit orders to say that you will only buy or sell at a given price. These sit in the market for a specified length of time and will be executed when an order arrives that matches the price (or better). Traders who set limit orders are called liquidity (or price) makers as they provide liquidity (i.e. volume to be traded) to be filled later. If there is no counterparty (i.e. buyer to your seller) in the market, a market maker; a large bank or brokerage who is licensed and regulated to do so, will fill your order at some price. That price is based on how much volume (i.e. trading) there is in that stock on average. This is called average daily volume (ADV) and is calculated over varying periods of time; we use ADV30 which is the 30 day average. You can always sell stocks for whatever price you like privately but a market order does not allow you to set your price (you are a price taker) therefore that kind of order will always fill at a market price. As mentioned above limit orders will not fill until the price is hit but will stay on book as long as they aren't filled, expired or cancelled.",
