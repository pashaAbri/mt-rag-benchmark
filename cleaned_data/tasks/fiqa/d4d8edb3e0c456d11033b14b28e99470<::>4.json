  "gold_answer": "A balance transfer involves moving your credit card debt from one card to another, usually to take advantage of a lower interest rate offer. It is a way to consolidate your debts. This can be a good strategy for managing high-interest debt short term, as it can help you save money on interest charges and pay off your debt faster. However, many balance transfer offers come with a fee,. This fee can add significantly to the cost of the transfer, so it's important to factor it into your decision. Second, many balance transfer offers are only available for a limited time,. After this period, the interest rate on the transferred balance may increase significantly. It's important to have a plan in place to pay off the balance before the introductory period ends. ",

Obviously the only reason to do this is refinancing debt to a lower interest rate.  You need to watch for loads on the incoming money, there may be an upwards of 5% fee.  This calculation is materially different than your APR.  Monthly interest charges can be estimated by taking your APR divided by 12 times your balance.  So a 15% APR will have a rough monthly interest charge of 1.25%.  The 5% balance transfer fee is 4x your normal interest charge.  That fee is added to your balance and now you pay interest on the whole amount.  You need to ensure the new rate is low enough to actually benefit you after the incoming fee.",

Some prefer to make one payment rather than multiple payments.  There is typically a fee that is imposed by the card that is originating or creating the loan.  This would be the credit card you are transferring the balances.  That fee is typically in the 3% to 5% range.   While tempting and attractive on the surface, this plan typically leads to a worse situation then you are now.   It's a \"\"tough pill to swallow\"\", but your problem is that you spend too much money.  Transferring money will not change this problem, it is your behavior that has to change in order to not accumulate more debt.  It has to change further if you want to get rid of the debt in a timely fashion.   You would be far better served to forget about this transfer and get your life into control.  Spend a lot less, earn more.  Pay off the cards you have now and cut them up.  Make a goal to be done in a year and figure out how to earn enough money to make that happen. BTW I am a reformed over-spender that now owes nothing.  Yep my house, cars, and rental property are all paid for.  You can get there too.\"",

You can also reduce the interest you pay on your cars if you are able to consolidate your debt into a personal loan. To your question about debt consolidation companies, as far as I know, that's all they do.  However, long-term, there's only two ways to stay on top of debt: increase your income, or reduce your spending.  Basically, if you can't or won't get a raise or a job that pays more (or a second job), you need to cut back on your spending.  You might need to do something radical, like move somewhere with cheaper rent (as long as increased travel costs doesn't offset the saving). But you'll be much better off in the long run if you step back and take a look at your situation now, and make adjustments accordingly.",

      "text": "\nSome things you should consider: Balance Transfer Debt Consolidation If you get approved for the Citibank 2 year interest free credit card on balance transfers, you will need another loan of $18K to consolidate your other debt. If you cannot get approval for the credit card you may need to get consolidation loan approval for your full $35K of debt. This approval again will depend on your income and your ability to make repayments. As it sounds like you don't have any assets, you may have to get an unsecured loan which comes with higher interest rates. Remember a consolidation loan is only worthwhile if you can get an interest rate lower than your current interest rates and if you pay as much as possible to reduce the term of the loan and the total interest you end up paying. You haven't given the interest rate for the consolidation loan, but lets assume you could get one at 12% p.a. over a 3 year period. For a loan of $18K you would have to pay $138 per week. Together with the $163.50 per week you would have to pay the credit card balance transfer, your total repayments per week for the first 2 years would be $301.50, then $138 per week for the 3rd year. This option sounds affordable, but without knowing what your income and current expenses are it is hard for others to determine for sure. If you had to get a consolidated loan for the full $35K at say 12% p.a. then your weekly repayments would be $268.30 over a 3 year period. This looks to be achievable too. Being Disciplined As you said you will need to be very disciplined in order to get out of this debt. You will need to set up a proper budget and watch every dollar you spend. You will need to restrict any spending on credit cards and getting any new personal loans. You say you will keep a small credit limit to pay for ongoing online payments for courses. Make sure you uses a 55 day interest free credit card (preferably with no annual fee) for this and pay the full amount due every month, so you don't end up paying any more interest on this card.
