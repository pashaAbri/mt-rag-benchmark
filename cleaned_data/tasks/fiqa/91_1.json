  "gold_answer": "Following an investment guru can be a good idea if you can afford the time and are looking for more in-depth, fun investment tips. However, it's crucial to understand what you're investing in, including the company's products, and to buy stock in good companies at good prices, considering factors like price to earnings, price to revenue, and price to book. Therefore, while following an investment guru can provide valuable insights, it's essential to conduct your own research and make informed decisions based on your understanding and investment goals. Blindly following other investors, including big investors or gurus, is not recommended, as their strategies may differ from yours. Instead, consider finding someone with similar goals to help guide your investment decisions.",

However, blindly following other investors is not a good idea.  Big investors strategies might not be similar to yours, they might be looking for something different than you.  If you're going to do that, find someone with similar goals. Having investments, and a strategy, that you believe in and understand is paramount to investing.  It's that belief, strategy, and understanding that will give you direction.  Otherwise you're just going to follow the herd and as they say, sheep get slaughtered.",
