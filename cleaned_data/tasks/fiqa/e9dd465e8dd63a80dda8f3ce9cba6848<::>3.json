  "gold_answer": "Enterprise value is the estimated cost of acquiring a company. Typically, companies are acquired without any debt or cash, so any cash on the balance sheet at the time of the transaction is given to the original owners. The Enterprise Value represents the fundamental total value of the firm. It excludes cash because paying for cash with cash doesn't make sense. This also simplifies the analysis of transaction multiples, as some companies might have a significant amount of extra cash on their balance sheet, which could distort the multiples.",

It doesn't include any cash because you'd basically be paying cash for cash. Also, this makes analysis of transaction multiples more streamlined, as some firms may have a ton of excess cash on their balance sheet, skewing multiples.\"\"  I said that that is WHY we use enterprise value. Because if you didn't it would skew multiples.\"",

Typically, companies are delivered debt-free and cash-free, so the cash on the balance sheet at the time of the transaction is distributed to the original owners. So, for instance, a company like Apple would have a lower EV than Market Value because the cash on the balance sheet is not going to be included in an acquisition.  And you are right, there are plenty of instances where you see Enterprise Value lower than Market Value (Cap).   If you are solely looking at equity valuation (equity investing), then use market cap. If you are looking at firm valuation for M&amp;A, then EV is more important.",
