  "gold_answer": "Yes, you can take out a loan to open a business. In fact you can give a loan to the company from yourself as a private person, and when the company makes money, the company pays it back to you. Then the company pays for all the expenses with the money from the loan.  it is noteworthy to mention that when you ask for business loan the bank looks at the background of the owners as it is a small business. Also it can depend of the bank as they need to understand the purpose of the loan and need it to be secured. hey may not even grant such kind of business loan. You really need to  show them a solid business plan and your profits for each year.",

However, if the points were earned on a personal credit card and used for business-related expenses, the employer can reimburse the employee for those expenses, and it seems the IRS follows an unofficial \"don't ask, don't tell\" rule regarding any rewards or cashback earned on the employee's personal card. It's important to note that credit card fees for personal expenses are not tax-deductible, while fees for business credit cards are deductible on Schedule C or the appropriate form for reporting business income and expenses. If you have a card used for both business and personal expenses, it's advisable to get separate cards for clarity and ease of accounting. In summary, while the expenses themselves may not be deductible when using credit card points, the employer can reimburse the employee for the expenses, and having separate cards for business and personal use is recommended.In other words, etting a personal card that you only use for business expenses, even if you don't opt for a business card.

Depending on what kind of business , it may have some federal rules to follow, but for the most part, it will be the locality (state, county, city) of the business that determines what  it need to be done even regards income taxes. It is best to start out creating a small business where you can control the content and grow that ends up being a fairly decent-paying job for yourself and maybe a couple other people.

      "text": "\nCredit card fees on a credit card used for personal expenses are not tax deductible. Credit card fees on a business credit card are deductible on schedule C (or whatever form you're using to report business income and expenses). If you are using the same card for both business and personal ... well, for starters, this is a very bad idea, because it creates exactly the question you're asking. If that's what you're doing, stop, and get separate business and personal cards. If you have separate business and personal cards -- and use the business card only for legitimate business expenses -- then the answer is easy: You can claim a schedule C deduction for any service charges on the business card, and you cannot claim any deduction for any charges on the personal card. In general, though, if you have an expense that is partly business and partly personal, you are supposed to figure out what percentage is business, and that is deductible. In an admittedly brief search, I couldn't find anything specifically about credit cards, but I did find this similar idea on the IRS web site: Generally, you cannot deduct personal, living, or family expenses. However, if you have an expense for something that is used partly for business and partly for personal purposes, divide the total cost between the business and personal parts. You can deduct the business part. For example, if you borrow money and use 70% of it for business and the other 30% for a family vacation, you can deduct 70% of the interest as a business expense. The remaining 30% is personal interest and is not deductible. Refer to chapter 4 of Publication 535, Business Expenses, for information on deducting interest and the allocation rules. (https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/deducting-business-expenses) So, PROBABLY, you could add up all the charges you made on the card, figure out how much was for business and how much for personal, calculate the business percentage, and then deduct this percentage of the service fees. If the amount involved is not trivial, you might want to talk to an accountant or a lawyer.",

      "text": "\n\"For simplicity, let's start by just considering cash back. In general, cash back from credit cards for personal use is not taxable, but for business use it is taxable (sort of, I'll explain later). The reason is most personal purchases are made with after tax dollars; you typically aren't deducting the cost of what you purchased from your personal income, so if you purchase something that costs $100 and you receive $2 back from the CC company, effectively you have paid $98 for that item but that wouldn't affect your tax bill. However, since businesses typically deduct most expenses, that same $100 deduction would have only been a $98 deduction for business tax purposes, so in this case the $2 should be accounted for. Note, you should not consider that $2 as income though; that would artificially inflate your revenue. It should be treated as a negative expense, similar to how you would handle returning an item you purchased and receiving a CC refund. Now for your specific questions: Part 1: As a small business owner, I wish to attend an annual seminar to improve my business. I have enough credit card reward points to cover the airfare, hotel, and rental car. Will those expenses still be deductible at the value displayed on the receipt? Effectively no, these expenses are not deductible. If you deduct them they will be completely counter-acted by the \"\"refund\"\" you receive for the payments. Part 2: Does it matter if those points are accrued on my personal credit card, rather than a business credit card? This is where it gets hairy. Suppose your company policy is that employees make purchases with their own personal credit cards and submit receipts for reimbursement. In this case the employer can simply reimburse and would not know or care if the employee is racking up rewards/points/cashback. The trick is, as the employee, you must always purchase business related items normally so you have receipts to show, and if you receive cashback on the side there seems to be a \"\"don't ask, don't tell\"\" rule that the IRS is OK with.",
