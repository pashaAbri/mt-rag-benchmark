  "gold_answer": "The concept of value is a subject where economic theories often differ, and each school of thought has valid points. One school of thought argues that monetary value can always be determined by the net labor involved or the cost of inputs. The other school of thought suggests that economic value does not exist inherently and that only the market can determine value. For instance, the value of a stock is solely determined by the price people are willing to pay for it and the price at which those who have it are willing to sell. Even if something drastic happens to a company, such as their only factory burning down and traders remaining indifferent, the value of the stock would not change in that scenario.",

      "text": "\nValue is one area where economic theories tend to diverge and the (very) basic schools of thought both have excellent points in their favor. You've identified both here; one being that economic value can always be determined by net labor* or at least cost of inputs and the other being that economic value does not exist in and of itself and that only a market can determine value. In some ways it is just a question of world-view as much as anything but the concepts of natural prices or innate worth are difficult to argue against. At the same time, without exchange the concept of value has little meaning. So, as usual, it is some sophistry mixed with some sense.  Both have elements of truth and both are considerably more complex than they seem at first. Interestingly though, neither seems to work very well as predictive models despite providing the basis for some incredibly complex and interesting mathematical workups.       * Note that net labor is the sum of ALL labor involved and is incredibly difficult to quantify accurately.",

      "text": "\n\"Yes, the value of a stock is completely, 100% determined by what people are willing to pay for it in conjunction with what people who have it are willing to sell it for. If something really bad happened to a company, like their only factory burned to the ground, and the traders didn't care, then I guess, in that scenario, the value of the stock would not change. But you can spin all sorts of hypotheticals of that sort. If dogs could talk, would German Shepherds speak German? Etc. Any answer is pretty meaningless because the premise is wildly unlikely. As CQM notes, \"\"traders\"\" in this context means everyone who buys or sells stock. If you buy stock, that includes you. They're not some mystical cabal somewhere. If you see a stock listed at, whatever, $50, and you are not willing to pay more than $40 for it, then you refuse to buy, and so you tend to force the price down. If you're not a billionaire, then your impact on the market is tiny, but the market is made up of millions of people each with tiny influence. Note that all this is true not just of the stock market, but of every product on the market. A product is worth whatever the owner is willing to sell it for and people are willing to pay. This is what determines the price of everything from houses to toasters. It's a little theory I've invented that I like to call, \"\"the law of supply and demand\"\". :-)\"",

Even if it takes the same effort to get 20 bushels of apples and a nugget of gold, if the majority of people find a nugget of gold to be worth 100 bushels, that will be the value of gold.   Conversely, lets say there is an element buried deep in the earth that has no use whatsoever. Even if it takes the effort of 10 nuggets of gold, because nobody has any use for it, its value will be zero. Even though there is high effort to procure.  I hope that clarifies your question of the exchange rate. It is determined by how much each party values the goods involved.",
