It's true that warming temperatures can have various impacts on ecosystems and the spread of certain diseases.  The average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880 and has nearly doubled in the last 50 years.",

But in the past century, another force has started to influence Earth\u2019s climate: humanity\nHow does this warming compare to previous changes in Earth\u2019s climate? How can we be certain that human-released greenhouse gases are causing the warming? How much more will the Earth warm? How will Earth respond? Answering these questions is perhaps the most significant scientific challenge of our time.\nWhat is Global Warming?\nGlobal warming is the unusually rapid increase in Earth\u2019s average surface temperature over the past century primarily due to the greenhouse gases released as people burn fossil fuels. The global average surface temperature rose 0.6 to 0.9 degrees Celsius (1.1 to 1.6\u00b0 F) between 1906 and 2005, and the rate of temperature increase has nearly doubled in the last 50 years. Temperatures are certain to go up further.\n\nDespite ups and downs from year to year, global average surface temperature is rising. By the beginning of the 21st century, Earth\u2019s temperature was roughly 0.5 degrees Celsius above the long-term (1951\u20131980) average. (NASA figure adapted from Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis.)\n\nEarth\u2019s natural greenhouse effect\nEarth\u2019s temperature begins with the Sun. Roughly 30 percent of incoming sunlight is reflected back into space by bright surfaces like clouds and ice. Of the remaining 70 percent, most is absorbed by the land and ocean, and the rest is absorbed by the atmosphere. The absorbed solar energy heats our planet.\nAs the rocks, the air, and the seas warm, they radiate \u201cheat\u201d energy (thermal infrared radiation). From the surface, this energy travels into the atmosphere where much of it is absorbed by water vapor and long-lived greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane.\nWhen they absorb the energy radiating from Earth\u2019s surface, microscopic water or greenhouse gas molecules turn into tiny heaters\u2014 like the bricks in a fireplace, they radiate heat even after the fire goes out. They radiate in all directions.",

But the current climatic warming is occurring much more rapidly than past warming events.\nWhy Do Scientists Think Current Warming Isn\u2019t Natural?\nIn Earth\u2019s history before the Industrial Revolution, Earth\u2019s climate changed due to natural causes unrelated to human activity. These natural causes are still in play today, but their influence is too small or they occur too slowly to explain the rapid warming seen in recent decades.\nHow Much More Will Earth Warm?\nModels predict that as the world consumes ever more fossil fuel, greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to rise, and Earth\u2019s average surface temperature will rise with them. Based on plausible emission scenarios, average surface temperatures could rise between 2\u00b0C and 6\u00b0C by the end of the 21st century. Some of this warming will occur even if future greenhouse gas emissions are reduced, because the Earth system has not yet fully adjusted to environmental changes we have already made.\nHow Will Earth Respond to Warming Temperatures?\nThe impact of global warming is far greater than just increasing temperatures. Warming modifies rainfall patterns, amplifies coastal erosion, lengthens the growing season in some regions, melts ice caps and glaciers, and alters the ranges of some infectious diseases. Some of these changes are already occurring.\nReferences and Related Resources\n\nGlobal Warming\nThroughout its long history, Earth has warmed and cooled time and again.

While natural variability plays some part, the preponderance of evidence indicates that human activities\u2014particularly emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases\u2014are mostly responsible for making our planet warmer.\nAccording to an ongoing temperature analysis led by scientists at NASA\u2019s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), the average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880. The majority of the warming has occurred since 1975, at a rate of roughly 0.15 to 0.20\u00b0C per decade.\nThe maps above show temperature anomalies in five-year increments since 1880. (Click on the arrow to run the animation.) These are not absolute temperatures, but changes from the norm for each area. The data reflect how much warmer or cooler each region was compared to a base period of 1951-1980. (The global mean surface air temperature for that period was 14\u00b0C (57\u00b0F), with an uncertainty of several tenths of a degree.)",
