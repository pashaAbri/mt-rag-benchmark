Some notable ones include the Mars Exploration Rovers, Sprit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in 2004; the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which has been studying Mars from orbit since 2006; the Mars Science Laboratory mission, which include the Curiosity rover that has been exploring Mars since 2012; and the InSight lander, which touched down on Mars in 2018 to study the planet's deep interior.  Additionally, there was the Mars Global Surveyor, which orbited Mars from 1997 to 2006, and Mars Pathfinder mission, which included the Sojourner rover and landed on Mars in 1997.  These are just few examples of the many missions and programs that have contributed to our understanding of Mars.",

Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech JPL's next rover to Mars is a modification of Curiosity and is named Perseverance. It was launched July 30, 2020. Instead of mineralogy, it will specialize in astrobiology and look specifically for signs of past life on Mars. Perseverance is also designed to collect and store rock samples on the Martian surface for retrieval by a future Mars sample return mission, formally approved by NASA in 2019. Perseverance also hosts a robotic helicopter named Ingenuity, a technology demonstration mission that will attempt powered flight on another planet.Competing for the planetsJPL was awarded a number of other Discovery program missions after Mars Pathfinder. The Stardust mission collected particles from comet Wild-2 in 2004, while the Genesis mission returned some particles from the solar wind in 2004. The Deep Impact mission launched a kinetic impactor at Comet Tempel 1 to assess its structure and composition in 2005. The GRAIL mission, based on the GRACE gravity satellites, produced very high resolution gravity maps of the Moon, while the Dawn mission used solar-electric propulsion to visit the dwarf planet Ceres and the largest main belt asteroid, Vesta. JPL also managed the development of Ames Research Center's Kepler exoplanet astronomy mission, launched in 2009. The Laboratory's most recent Discovery program mission, InSight, landed on Mars Nov. 26, 2018. Its mission was to measure martian seismic activity and the heat flow coming from Mars' interior. JPL's next Discovery mission, Psyche, is being designed to explore the unusual main belt asteroid 16 Psyche during the late 2020s.

So, in 2003, they sent two rovers to the Red Planet. The rovers were named Spirit and Opportunity. Together, they were part of the Mars Exploration Rover mission.\r\nSpirit and Opportunity were made as twins. They both carried all of the same scientific instruments. And each was about the size of a golf cart.\r\n\nOn Earth, where there is water, there is life. Spirit and Opportunity were sent to Mars to find more clues about the history of water there, and to see if the Red Planet could ever have supported life. To do this, scientists sent the two rovers to two different landing sites. The rovers landed on opposite sides of the planet. \r\n\nThe landing sites of all four Mars rovers on a map of Mars. Credit: National Geographic Society, MOLA Science Team, MSS, JPL, NASA\nSpirit landed in a region called Gusev Crater. Scientists wanted to explore the crater because they thought it could have held water long ago. From pictures taken by satellites, scientists thought it looked like several large rivers flowed into Gusev Crater.\r\nOpportunity landed on the other side of Mars in an area called Meridiani Planum. This region was nice because it was a flat, safe spot for the rover to land. Also, studies with a satellite around Mars showed that it might contain a mineral called grey hematite. On Earth, grey hematite is often found in the presence of water. \r\n\nOpportunity found grey hematite in sphere-like grains in Meridiani Planum. Scientists called these grains \u201cblueberries.\u201d On Earth, hematite forms near water.",

      "text": "History\nThe Mars Surveyor program came to an end in 2000, after the failure of two missions launched in 1998, the Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander.Mars Observer's loss also helped enable NASA to gain approval for another planetary mission program, known as Discovery. The Discovery Program required NASA centers and university-based scientists to submit proposals to competitions that were to be held every few years. To get the program going, the first two Discovery missions were assigned. JPL was awarded Mars Pathfinder. The Mars Pathfinder mission introduced what has become a powerful technology for planetary exploration: the planetary rover. The USSR had landed robotic rovers on the Moon, and it had tried to land a miniature rover on Mars in the 1970s but had failed. Mars Pathfinder's micro-rover, named Sojourner, for abolitionist Sojourner Truth, in 1997 became the first robotic rover to explore the Red Planet. The Sojourner rover sampling a convenient rock next to the Mars Pathfinder lander. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech Mars Pathfinder also pioneered a new policy of releasing imagery to the public in almost real time, via the newly public World Wide Web. Finally, Mars Pathfinder was also inexpensive, and justified an agency drive to reduce the cost of planetary missions even further.After the failures of the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander, NASA approved the Mars Exploration Rover mission, whose two rovers were named \"Spirit\" and \"Opportunity\" after their launch in July 2003. The two were equipped for robotic geology, looking for signs that liquid water having ever existed on the surface. They operated until 2010 and 2018, respectively, roving nearly nearly 33 miles (53 kilometers) between them. Among their many spectacular findings: at some time in Mars' deep past, water had flowed on the surface. Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity looks back at its lander shell in 2004. Credit: NASA/JPL/Cornell NASA also approved a large orbiter to help discover suitable landing sites for a future Mars sample return project.
