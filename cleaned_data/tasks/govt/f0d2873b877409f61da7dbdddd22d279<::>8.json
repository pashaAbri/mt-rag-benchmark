  "gold_answer": "Spousal support, also known as alimony, is a payment made by a higher-earning spouse to a lower-earning spouse. Temporary or pendente lite orders are issued any time after the Petition is filed until the Final Judgment is entered. These orders are intended to maintain the parties' status quo until a final judgment on all issues can be ordered, including custody, visitation, child support, and spousal support. A party who cannot file for divorce due to not meeting the residency requirements or does not wish to end the marriage for psychological or economic reasons may file for legal separation. In this case, a judicial officer, a court official, can make orders for child support and/or spousal support, custody and visitation, and division of property.",

This property is owned equally by the parties. The same applies to debts acquired during the marriage.\n\nSEPARATE PROPERTY is any property, whether real or personal, acquired by a party before they married, after \r\n the date of separation with separate funds or during the marriage by gift or inheritance. This property belongs solely to the party acquiring it.\n\nLEGAL CUSTODY applies to the right and responsibility to make decisions regarding the health, education and \r\n welfare of the minor child. SOLE LEGAL CUSTODY means that only one parent has the right to make these decisions. \r\n Usually, the court will order JOINT LEGAL CUSTODY which means that either parent may make the decisions unless \r\n the court specifies circumstances requiring joint consent.\n\nPHYSICAL CUSTODY addresses the period of time each parent will have the child in his or her physical custody. \r\n An order for JOINT PHYSICAL CUSTODY does not necessarily mean a 50/50 custody arrangement but instead that each \r\n parent will have significant periods of physical custody. A SOLE PHYSICAL CUSTODY order means that the child will \r\n reside primarily with one parent who will have the day-to-day care of the child and the other parent will have \u00e2\u0080\u0098visitation\u00e2\u0080\u0099 on specified times.\n\nGUIDELINE CHILD SUPPORT is the amount of child support which is presumed to be correct. This is a complicated \r\n formula which has been turned into a computer program called DISSOMASTER. This program calculates Guideline child \r\n support and may be used to calculate temporary spousal support but not \u00e2\u0080\u0098long-term\u00e2\u0080\u0099 spousal support.\n\nSPOUSAL SUPPORT is a payment made by a higher earning spouse to a lower earning spouse. SS used to be called \u00e2\u0080\u0098alimony\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\n\nTEMPORARY or PENDENTE LITE ORDERS are orders that are issued at any time after the Petition is \r\n filed until the Final Judgment is entered. Often these orders are designed to maintain the \u00e2\u0080\u0098status quo\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the parties until a final \r\n judgment on all issues can be ordered and involve issues of custody, visitation, child and/or spousal support.\n\nSERVICE or SERVICE OF PROCESS is the procedure whereby a party is given copies of certain documents",

      "text": "Family Law | Superior Court of California | County of Tulare\nA party who either can't file for divorce because he or she doesn't meet the residency requirements or does not wish to end the marriage for psychological or economic reasons may file a legal separation. The judicial officer can make orders for child support and/or spousal support, custody and visitation, and division of property; however, the parties remain legally married, even though they may be living apart.\nYou may ask the judge to declare that your marriage is not valid by filing an annulment (nullity of marriage). There are several reasons for why a judge may say that a marriage is not legally valid. For example, a marriage that is incestuous (between close blood relatives) or bigamous (where a spouse is already married to someone else) is never legally valid.\nCustody and Visitation\nThe Petition for Custody and Support of Minor Children may be filed by parents who:\nHave signed a Voluntary Declaration of Paternity, or\nAre married and don't want to get legally separated or divorced, or\nAre not married and have legally adopted a child together, or\nHave been determined to be the parents in a juvenile or Department of Child Support case\nBy filing this petition, the parents may ask the court to make custody and support orders, in addition to other orders.\nYou may also ask the court to make orders for child support, spousal support, custody, and visitation by filing an Order to Show Cause or a Notice of Motion on an existing divorce, legal separation, or nullity, domestic partnership, or paternity case.\nPaternity\nEstablishing paternity means saying who the legal parents of a child are if the parents were not married when the child was born.\nA child's parentage must be established before you can get child support or custody and visitation orders. By filing the Petition to Establish Parental Relationship, you may ask the court for child support or custody and visitation as part of this case.\nDomestic Partnerships\nDomestic partners are defined as \"two adults who have chosen to share one another's lives in an intimate and committed relationship of mutual caring.\"\nTo dissolve (terminate) a Domestic Partnership, you may file a Petition for Dissolution.\nHow to Get a Domestic Violence Restraining Order\nWhat is a restraining order?",
