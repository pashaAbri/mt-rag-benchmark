The problem is serious because up to 10 percent of the world\u2019s population lives in coastal cities and in vulnerable areas less than 10 meters (about 30 feet) above sea level. It can also impact ecosystems. Even NASA has been affected as half to two-thirds of its space infrastructure and assets stand within 5 meters of sea level. The acceleration of the rise of the sea level  has been driven mainly by increased ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica, and it has the potential to double the total sea level rise projected by 2100.",

        "text": "Global Warming\nWith some exceptions, the tropics will likely receive less rain (orange) as the planet warms, while the polar regions will receive more precipitation (green). White areas indicate that fewer than two-thirds of the climate models agreed on how precipitation will change. Stippled areas reveal where more than 90 percent of the models agreed. (\u00a92007 IPCC WG1 AR-4.)\n\nIt is impossible to pin any single unusual weather event on global warming, but emerging evidence suggests that global warming is already influencing the weather. Heat waves, droughts, and intense rain events have increased in frequency during the last 50 years, and human-induced global warming more likely than not contributed to the trend.\nRising Sea Levels\nThe weather isn\u2019t the only thing global warming will impact: rising sea levels will erode coasts and cause more frequent coastal flooding. Some island nations will disappear. The problem is serious because up to 10 percent of the world\u2019s population lives in vulnerable areas less than 10 meters (about 30 feet) above sea level.\nBetween 1870 and 2000, the sea level increased by 1.7 millimeters per year on average, for a total sea level rise of 221 millimeters (0.7 feet or 8.7 inches). And the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Since 1993, NASA satellites have shown that sea levels are rising more quickly, about 3 millimeters per year, for a total sea level rise of 48 millimeters (0.16 feet or 1.89 inches) between 1993 and 2009.\n\nSea levels crept up about 20 centimeters (7.9 inches) during the twentieth century. Sea levels are predicted to go up between 18 and 59 cm (7.1 and 23 inches) over the next century, though the increase could be greater if ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica melt more quickly than predicted. Higher sea levels will erode coastlines and cause more frequent flooding. (Graph \u00a92007 Robert Rohde.)\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that sea levels will rise between 0.18 and 0.59 meters (0.59 to 1.9 feet) by 2099 as warming sea water expands, and mountain and polar glaciers melt.",

Higher sea levels will erode coastlines and cause more frequent flooding. (Graph \u00a92007 Robert Rohde.)\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that sea levels will rise between 0.18 and 0.59 meters (0.59 to 1.9 feet) by 2099 as warming sea water expands, and mountain and polar glaciers melt. These sea level change predictions may be underestimates, however, because they do not account for any increases in the rate at which the world\u2019s major ice sheets are melting. As temperatures rise, ice will melt more quickly. Satellite measurements reveal that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are shedding about 125 billion tons of ice per year\u2014enough to raise sea levels by 0.35 millimeters (0.01 inches) per year. If the melting accelerates, the increase in sea level could be significantly higher.\nImpacting Ecosystems\nMore importantly, perhaps, global warming is already putting pressure on ecosystems, the plants and animals that co-exist in a particular climate zone, both on land and in the ocean. Warmer temperatures have already shifted the growing season in many parts of the globe. The growing season in parts of the Northern Hemisphere became two weeks longer in the second half of the 20th century. Spring is coming earlier in both hemispheres.\nThis change in the growing season affects the broader ecosystem. Migrating animals have to start seeking food sources earlier. The shift in seasons may already be causing the lifecycles of pollinators, like bees, to be out of synch with flowering plants and trees. This mismatch can limit the ability of both pollinators and plants to survive and reproduce, which would reduce food availability throughout the food chain.\nSee Buzzing About Climate Change to read more about how the lifecycle of bees is synched with flowering plants.\nWarmer temperatures also extend the growing season. This means that plants need more water to keep growing throughout the season or they will dry out, increasing the risk of failed crops and wildfires.",

        "text": "Sea Level Rise is Accelerating\n\u201cThis is almost certainly a conservative estimate,\u201d said Nerem, who is a member of NASA\u2019s Sea Level Change team. \u201cOur extrapolation assumes that sea level continues to change in the future as it has over the last 25 years. Given the large changes we are seeing in the ice sheets today, that is not likely.\u201d\nRising concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere increase the temperature of air and water, which causes sea level to rise in two ways. First, warmer water expands, and this \u201cthermal expansion\u201d of the ocean has contributed about half of the 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) of global mean sea level rise that has been observed over the past 25 years, Nerem said. Second, the water from melting land ice flows into the ocean, which also increases sea level around the world.\nThe rate of sea level rise has risen from about 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inch) per year in the 1990s to about 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year today. These increases have been measured by satellite altimeters since 1992, including the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 missions, which have been jointly managed by NASA, France\u2019s Centre national d'etudes spatiales (CNES), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The maps on this page depict the changes in sea level observed by those satellites between 1992 and 2014.\n\n1992 - 2014PNG\n\n\u201cThe TOPEX/Poseidon/Jason altimetry missions have been essentially providing the equivalent of a global network of nearly half a million accurate tide gauges, providing sea surface height information every 10 days for over 25 years,\u201d said Brian Beckley of NASA Goddard. \u201cAs this climate data record approaches three decades, the fingerprints of Greenland and Antarctic land-based ice loss are now being revealed in the global and regional mean sea level estimates.\u201d\nEven with a 25-year data record, it can be challenging to detect acceleration. Episodes like volcanic eruptions can create variability; for instance, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 decreased global mean sea level just before the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite launch.",

    "original_text": "The rising sea levels pose several dangers. For one, they can cause more frequent and severe coastal flooding, which can lead to the displacement of people living in low-lying coastal areas. Additionally, higher sea levels can lead to the erosion of coastlines, which can damage infrastructure and property. In some cases, entire islands or coastal communities may become uninhabitable due to the impacts of sea level rise. Furthermore, sea level rise can exacerbate the impacts of storm surges during hurricanes and other extreme weather events, leading to even greater damages. Finally, rising sea levels can also impact groundwater supplies, as saltwater intrusion becomes more common in coastal aquifers."
