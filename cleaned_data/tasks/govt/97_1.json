  "gold_answer": "Previous missions were sent to Jupiter like Pioneer 10 and 11 and also Voyager 1 and 2 in the 1970s. But  the two spacecrafts most famous to reach Jupiter were Juno and Galileo. Juno began its circuitous five-year journey to Jupiter on August 5  of 2011 and it was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast . Juno mission completed its 50th close pass by Jupiter since its arrived at the big planet in 2016.  Galileo mission to Jupiter had been authorized in October 1977 for a 1982 space shuttle launch, but there were some delays to the shuttle program, confusion over the development of an appropriate upper stage to send the probe on its way out of Earth orbit, and finally the loss of space shuttle Challenger and its crew in 1986, postponed Galileo's launch until 1989. Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.",

Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech The atmospheric entry probe carried by Galileo was developed by NASA Ames Research Center. The probe entered the Jovian atmosphere on Dec. 7, 1995, measuring the composition of Jupiter's atmosphere until it was crushed, as expected, by extreme pressure. The Galileo orbiter lasted until September 2003, when JPL ordered it to plunge into Jupiter's atmosphere to ensure that it would not crash into, and contaminate, any of Jupiter's moons. Among other things, Galileo found a water ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet, and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.JPL branches outThe downturn in planetary exploration funding during the 1970s had one welcome consequence: JPL began to seek other kinds of spaceflight tasks. This led the Lab into astronomy and Earth science.One of JPL's technology development efforts in the mid-1970s had been research on improving charge-coupled detectors (CCDs) for use in space. This work was intended for the Galileo camera system, but also resulted in the Laboratory being awarded the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera in 1978. Intended to be the observatory's primary imaging instrument, WFPC operated flawlessly when the telescope was finally launched in 1990.WFPC also helped pinpoint a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's primary mirror. It had been polished to just slightly the wrong shape. The error made Hubble a hugely expensive laughing stock shortly after launch, but JPL scientists realized they could rescue the mission by installing corrective optics in an updated camera. JPL developed the camera, WFPC2, which was installed on Hubble by astronauts in 1993, and operated until removed during a servicing mission in 2009.",

      "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nThe self-destruct maneuver would have satisfied NASA\u2019s planetary protection requirements, avoiding any chance Juno could crash into the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, or Callisto \u2013 ocean worlds, with Europa in particular considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth \u2013 and contaminate them with microscopic life from Earth.\u00a0\u00a0The Cassini mission, orbiting Saturn from 2004 to 2017, prompted similar concerns \u2013 protecting the integrity of Saturn\u2019s moons Enceladus and Titan, also believed to contain possibly habitable environments. As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno\u2019s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter\u2019s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere.\u00a0Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet.

In celebration of 50 orbits, this graphic contains 50 images that provide just a small sampling of the data Juno has returned so far, including images from JunoCam and other instruments, and spectacular views of Earth, Jupiter, and Jupiter\u2019s large moons Ganymede, Europa, and Io. https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/news/nasa-s-juno-mission-marks-50-orbits-around-jupiter JunoCam Images20 ImagesGo To GalleryGo To GalleryLaunch and Cruise PhasesJuno began its circuitous five-year journey to Jupiter on Aug. 5, 2011, launching from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast.\u00a0\u00a0With the four-ton probe and its wide solar arrays folded inside the nose, an Atlas V rocket thundered aloft at 12:25 p.m. EDT (26:25:00 UT) from Launch Complex 41 \u2013 the same pad where the Voyager and New Horizons spacecraft took flight, and where the Viking landers, and Curiosity and Perseverance rovers headed to Mars.\u00a0Juno, likewise, set a course away from Earth toward the outer planets. It crossed the orbit of Mars, but didn\u2019t continue onto Jupiter quite yet. Mission designers used the Sun\u2019s gravity and a pair of main engine burns in September 2012 to guide Juno back toward Earth \u2013 an essential detour.\u00a0\u00a0Juno returned home 26 months after it left. But it didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0\u00a0It dashed toward Earth, pulled in by gravity, then sped away with greater energy than before. In this maneuver, called a gravity assist, Juno borrowed some momentum from Earth \u2013 which itself is hurtling through space around the Sun at 18 miles per second (29 kilometers per second). This slingshot effect boosted Juno\u2019s velocity by 16,330 mph (about 7.3 kilometers per second), giving the spacecraft sufficient energy to climb away from the inner solar system and make it out to Jupiter.",
