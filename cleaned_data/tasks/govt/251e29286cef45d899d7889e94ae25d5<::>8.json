Vaccines are a safer way for your body to learn to make antibodies to some of the more dangerous viruses, like COVID-19. But vaccines use the same natural process of your immune system, which is already activated often by germs and viruses.\u00a0\nWe know that COVID-19 vaccines work well to prevent severe illness and death from COVID-19.\u00a0Scientists continue to study the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines as new variants appear.\nAs the vaccine science evolves, the CDC may recommend additional updated vaccines. That shouldn\u2019t prevent you from getting a dose of COVID-19 vaccine now if you\u2019re eligible.\n\nLast updated: January 24, 2024\n\nFeedback",

In contrast, mRNA COVID-19 vaccines\u00a0(Pfizer, Moderna) teach our body how to make the spike protein to induce an immune response.\n\n mRNA COVID-19 vaccines don\u2019t change your DNA \n \n\nmRNA vaccines that protect you from COVID-19 don\u2019t alter your DNA.

This includes making antibodies that help kill or neutralize the virus. If you\u2019re exposed to the same virus again, these antibodies also help your immune system recognize and fight the virus quickly.\nLearn more about how COVID-19 vaccines work on the CDC website\nHow vaccines protect the people around you\nProtecting whole communities from diseases like COVID-19 is an important reason for everyone to get vaccines. We call this \u201ccommunity immunity.\u201d\nWhen enough people are vaccinated and develop immunity to a certain virus, that virus can\u2019t spread as easily from person to person. This means that everyone in the community is less likely to get infected.",
