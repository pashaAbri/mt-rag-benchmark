  "gold_answer": "To make the game more interesting, you can consider adding various features such as: 1.  Increase the complexity of the terrain or add more hazards from steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly.  2. Specify a landing site by creating scripts that place the rover at a certain location at the beginning of the game.  3.  Let others play it and suggest improvements.",

Add a countdown timer NASA\u2019s missions to Mars and other destinations have a planned life expectancy. Some missions, including every Mars rover to date, have been extended and operated beyond their planned mission life expectancy, while others experience problems that shorten their mission. You can create a timer that counts down to the end of the mission and ends the game. Your timer should not be so short that the game is unplayable or unwinnable, but it should not be so long that there is no challenge to playing the game. As a bonus, you can create code to extend or shorten the planned mission time.\nTasks\n\nCreate a timer that counts from a set time down to zero. Hint: Create a Time variable that you can program to change. (See example image.)\nMake gameplay stop when the timer reaches zero.\nMake a \u201cMission Over\u201d message appear when the timer reaches zero.\nMake the timer start over when a player clicks the green flag to restart the game.\nBonus: Develop code that will increase or decrease the amount of time on the timer by one or two seconds at random.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n5. Add a scoring system Rover missions on Mars don\u2019t have a scoring system. But the science they collect is valuable, and some discoveries may be more exciting, interesting, or important than others. To determine how well players are doing while playing your game, you can develop a scoring system that includes points earned for collecting sample tubes. How points are totaled is up to you. You could also program your game to reduce point totals in certain scenarios (see Step 6, for example).\nTasks\n\nDevelop code to create a scoring system.\nIncrease the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n6. Add hazards Space travel and other worlds are fraught with hazards. From steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly. Program your game to include hazards that players need to avoid.",
