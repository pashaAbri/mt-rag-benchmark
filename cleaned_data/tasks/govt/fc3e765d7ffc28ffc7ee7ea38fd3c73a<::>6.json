The program, run by the State Controller\u2019s Office (SCO), provides loans to low-income seniors, individuals who are blind, or disabled homeowners so they can cover their property taxes and remain in their homes.

The PTP program, operated by the State Controller\u2019s Office (SCO), provides loans to low-income seniors, blind, or disabled homeowners to pay their property taxes and stay in their homes. Homeowners then repay the loans plus interest at a later date\u2014often when the home is sold or transferred. The PTP program has seen some significant changes over the last 15 years, including:\n\nProgram Suspension in 2009. In response to statewide budget challenges, the program was suspended from 2009 to 2014, during which time it no longer accepted applications or made property tax payments to counties.\nNew Structure for Reinstated Program in 2014. A modified version of the program was reinstated in 2014. \u00a0First, all loan repayments go through the newly established the Senior Citizens and Disabled Citizens Property Tax Postponement Fund (PTP Fund) and the money is used to make annual property payments to counties and support program administrative costs. The intent of this change was to make the program self-funded. That is, program costs are paid for with loan repayments without general taxpayer support.",

The intent of this change was to make the program self-funded. That is, program costs are paid for with loan repayments without general taxpayer support. (Previously, all program revenues and expenditures would go through the General Fund.) Second, the state also established a $15 million cap on the PTP fund balance. When the fund balance exceeds this threshold\u2014as it did from 2017-2018 through 2019-2020 by a total of $7.9 million\u2014those funds are transferred to the General Fund. Third, in order to qualify, homeowners must have at least 40 percent equity in the home.\nReduced Interest Rates and Raised Income Eligibility Threshold in 2019.\u00a0 The Legislature modified the program in 2019, including reducing interest rates on the loans (7 percent to 5 percent), raising income eligibility thresholds ($35,000 per year to $45,000 per year and growing with inflation), and expanding the program to include manufactured homes.\n\nProposal\nBudget Proposes $7.5 Million General Fund Transfer to the PTP Fund. The Governor\u2019s budget would provide the Department of Finance authority to transfer $7.5 million from the General Fund to the PTP Fund to ensure there are adequate resources available to cover costs in 2024-25. (This transfer is located in budget item 9100-111-0001.) Program expenditures ($9 million) are expected to exceed revenues ($5.4 million) in 2024-25 and the fund balance is insufficient to ensure adequate resources to provide loans in the budget year.\nAssessment\nStructural Deficit in PTP Fund Puts Ongoing Cost Pressure on General Fund. As shown in the figure below, expenditures have exceeded revenues over the last few years, with the gap growing in recent years. This imbalance is expected to continue for at least the next few years.",

    "original_text": "Yes, there is assistance available for property taxes for homeowners in California. One such program is the Property Tax Postponement (PTP) program, which allows eligible homeowners to postpone payment of property taxes on their primary residence. To be eligible, homeowners must be seniors (62 or older), blind, or disabled, and have an annual income of $45,000 or less. The program is administered by the California State Controller's Office. Additionally, some local counties and cities may offer property tax relief programs for homeowners who meet certain criteria. It's recommended to check with local government offices for more information on available programs."
