      "text": "Moon Phases\nWe call this motion synchronous rotation.Daily Moon GuideCheck out NASA's interactive map for observing the Moon each day of the year.Go to the guidePhasesIn our entire solar system, the only object that shines with its own light is the Sun. That light always beams onto Earth and Moon from the direction of the Sun, illuminating half of our planet in its orbit and reflecting off the surface of the Moon to create moonlight.Like Earth, the Moon has a day side and a night side, which change as the Moon rotates. The Sun always illuminates half of the Moon while the other half remains dark, but how much we are able to see of that illuminated half changes as the Moon travels through its orbit.This graphic shows the position of the Moon and the Sun during each of the Moon\u2019s phases and the Moon as it appears from Earth during each phase. Not to scale.NASA/JPL-CaltechLet\u2019s take a look at the individual phases, and how the movements of the Moon and Sun appear to us as we watch from the Northern Hemisphere on Earth:New MoonThis is the invisible phase of the Moon, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing the Sun and the night side facing Earth. In this phase, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun and rises and sets with the Sun. Not only is the illuminated side facing away from the Earth, it\u2019s also up during the day! Remember, in this phase, the Moon doesn\u2019t usually pass directly between Earth and the Sun, due to the inclination of the Moon\u2019s orbit. It only passes near the Sun from our perspective on Earth.Waxing CrescentThis silver sliver of a Moon occurs when the illuminated half of the Moon faces mostly away from Earth, with only a tiny portion visible to us from our planet. It grows daily as the Moon\u2019s orbit carries the Moon\u2019s dayside farther into view. Every day, the Moon rises a little bit later.First QuarterThe Moon is now a quarter of the way through its monthly journey and you see half of its illuminated side. People may casually call this a half moon, but remember, that\u2019s not really what you\u2019re witnessing in the sky. You\u2019re seeing just a slice of the entire Moon \u2015 half of the illuminated half.",
