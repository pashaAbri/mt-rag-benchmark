      "text": "FAQs \u2022 Monterey Park, CA \u2022 CivicEngage\nRain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater. Thus, keeping our groundwater resource clean is vitally important to all of us. \t\n\n7.\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze. These products are not only hazardous to our health, but to our environment. By disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\t\n\n8.\nCan contaminated groundwater be cleaned up?\n\r\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. Communities whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the cost of providing the water to customers. It is far better to prevent contamination in the first place.\u00a0What are the dos and do nots for groundwater?Do: Purchase only what you need Use products completely before disposing Recycle whatever you can (oil, batteries, etc.) Recycle surplus paintsDo not: Dump products onto the ground (they can contaminate soil and groundwater) Pour products or wastes into the street (they can contaminate oceans, lakes, and groundwater) Put hazardous or toxic products in the trash Pour products down the drainView proper disposal of Household Hazardous Wastes online. \n\n9.\nIs our water fluoridated?\n\r\nAt this time fluoride is not added to the water. There are low levels of fluoride naturally occurring in the water. The range at which they occur is between 0.2 to 0.8 milligrams per liter (mg/L).",
