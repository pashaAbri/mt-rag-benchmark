Most Californians maintain financial responsibility through insurance companies, which provide the policy holder with an identification card to be used as proof of coverage. The card must state the insurance company\u2019s name and address, the period of coverage, and policy number.\nFinancial responsibility in California requires that drivers and vehicle owners carry the following minimum dollar limits:\n\n$15,000 for injury or death of 1 person per accident.\n$30,000 for injury or death of 2 or more persons per accident.\n$5,000 for any property damage per accident.\n\nWhen parents or guardians sign for a minor to get a DL, they are stating that they will accept financial responsibility for that minor.\nI\u2019m almost 18. Do I need to take driver education/driver training (DE/DT) in order to get my instruction permit?\nIf you are over 17 \u00bd but under 18 years of age, you may get your instruction permit without the DE/DT certificates. However, you will not be able to take the driving test until you are 18 years of age.\nWhat do I do if I completed my DE/DT in another state? (Applies to applicants under 18 years of age) \nIf your DE/DT were completed in a state other than California, DMV will accept a letter from your out-of-state secondary school on the school\u2019s official stationery. The letter must be signed by a school official stating that the completed courses you have taken are equivalent to a California secondary school course as described in Section 10020 of Title 5 of the\u00a0California Code of Regulations\u00a0and on form \u201cTo Secondary Schools Other Than California Schools\u201d (DL 33). Obtain a DL 33 form from your local\u00a0DMV office\u00a0or by calling DMV at 1-800-777-0133. Send the DL 33 form to your out-of-state school for completion. An out-of-state driving instruction\u00a0permit is not acceptable proof of DE/DT.\nWhat if my provisional instruction permit expires before I take the driving test?",
