  "gold_answer": "Certainly! 1. Comet 9P/Tempel 1: This is a periodic comet with an orbital period of 5.51 years. It has a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which places it between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The nucleus of Tempel 1 is estimated to be around 14 km long and 4 km wide. 2. Comet 103P/Hartley 2: Also known as Hartley 2, this is another periodic comet with an orbital period of 6.46 years. Its semi-major axis is 3.46 AU, and it has a perihelion distance of 1.05 AU. The nucleus of Hartley 2 is elongated, measuring about 2 km long by 0.5 km wide. ",

      "text": "NASA - NSSDCA - Spacecraft - Details\nThis phase of the mission began 26 January 2008 and continued until the end of July. The spacecraft made three close Earth / Moon flybys to target itself for Hartley 2, on 31 December 2007, 29 December 2008, and 27 June 2010. Scientific observations of the Earth and Moon were made. The encounter with Hartley 2 took place on 4 November 2010 at approximately 14:00 UT (10:00 a.m. EDT) at a distance of roughly 700 km. The spacecraft and comet were 1.064 AU from the Sun and 0.156 AU from Earth at encounter. Approach phase angle was 86 degrees, MRI resolution at closest approach was 7 m per pixel. The two extended missions together are known as EPOXI. Following Hartley 2, remote observations were made of Comet Garradd (C/2009 P1) and comet ISON (C/2012 S1). After a period in which communications could not be established in 2013, it was concluded on 16 September 2013 that the spacecraft was lost, and end of mission was announced on 19 September. Total cost of the extended mission is $40 million.\n\nComet Tempel 1\n\nComet 9P/Tempel 1 is a periodic comet which orbits the Sun every 5.51 years. It has a semi-major axis of 3.12 astronomical units (AU, the distance from the Sun to the Earth) and a perihelion distance of 1.5 AU, which puts it between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Its orbit is inclined 10.5 degrees to the ecliptic. The orbit has changed in the past but the perihelion has been within 10 AU for at least 300,000 years. The nucleus is estimated to be roughly 14 km long and 4 km wide. The perihelion occurs on 5 July 2005, the day after the encounter. The comet was discovered on 3 April 1867 by Ernst Wilhelm Leberecht Tempel and was first recognized to be periodic in May of that year by C. Bruhns.\n\nComet Hartley 2",
