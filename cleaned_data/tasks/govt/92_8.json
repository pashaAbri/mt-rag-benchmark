  "gold_answer": "If you are allergic to latex, you should avoid contact with natural rubber latex products. If you have to wear gloves in your work, ask your employer for nonlatex gloves. Avoid areas where you might inhale the powder from latex gloves worn by other workers. Wear a personal medical emergency ID bracelet. If prescribed by your physician, carry an emergency epinephrine kit in case you are accidentally exposed to latex and go into anaphylactic shock. Learn how to use it and make sure family members, friends and fellow employees know how to use it. If you use latex-based products on the job, alert your employer about your allergy. Before dental and medical procedures or examinations, alert health care providers about your allergy. Ask to be scheduled as the first patient in the morning to minimize your exposure to airborne latex particles. Participate in educational and training programs regarding latex allergy. If the allergy sufferer is a child, alert school and/or day care providers. Work with your allergist, local hospital and medical facilities to find latex-safe environments where you can go for treatment. Contact your local emergency responders (police, fire and ambulance service) to inform them of your condition so a plan of care can be developed before there is an actual emergency. Health care facilities are beginning to create latex-safe treatment areas and surgical suites to accommodate people who are allergic to latex. Check with your local hospital.",

      "text": "Latex Allergy Information\nThis sap is used in manufacturing latex products. If someone who is sensitive to this protein comes in contact with it by touching or breathing it, an allergic reaction can occur. This allergic reaction can range from a simple skin rash to shock (which is rare). The amount of latex exposure needed to produce sensitization or an allergic reaction is unknown, but frequent exposure to latex proteins increases the risk.\nPeople who experience allergic symptoms should avoid contact until medically evaluated. Some other chemicals used in the manufacture of gloves may also cause sensitization and serious reactions, particularly skin reactions.\nWhat items contain natural rubber latex?\nLatex is used in a variety of products. Many everyday items contain latex but not all brands of all these items always contain latex. Check labels or contact the manufacturer. Following are examples of some products that may contain latex:\n\nmedical devices, such as gloves, syringes, blood pressure cuffs, bandages, IV tubes and catheters;\ndental items, such as toothbrushes with rubber grips, irrigation tips, dams, orthodontic rubber bands and elastic;\nclothing items, such as the elastic waistband in pants, underwear, sneakers, socks and pantyhose, swimsuits;\nchildren's items such as bottle nipples, diapers, rubber pants, pacifiers, teething toys, infant gum massagers and toys;\nhousehold items such as flooring, rug mats, bathmats, rubber gloves, tires and mats;\npersonal care items such as diaphragms, condoms and adult diapers;\noffice supplies such as rubber bands and erasers;\nschool supplies such as erasers, rubber cement and paint.\n\nHow common is an allergy to natural rubber latex?\nIt is difficult to determine just how widespread a problem latex allergy may be. Less than 1 percent of the general population is reported to have a reaction to latex. Despite this, more than 1,700 cases of latex allergy have been reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) since 1988. Many more cases probably go unreported. Latex allergy reactions occur more frequently in high-risk professions due to increased exposure to latex products.",

Likewise, if you are allergic to any of the food items listed below, you may also be allergic to latex. If you are allergic to any of the listed food items, inform your doctor before undergoing any medical procedure. People allergic to these foods have been known to have cross allergic reactions during surgery.\nWhat foods may cause a cross reaction?\nFollowing are some foods that may cause a cross reaction:\n\napples, bananas, kiwi, peaches, plums, figs, grapes, melons, papaya, passion fruit, cherries, nectarines, pears, pineapple and strawberries;\ncarrots, celery, raw potatoes, avocados and tomatoes;\nchestnuts and hazelnuts;\nwheat and rye.\n\nWhat can I do to reduce the risk of developing an allergy to latex?\n\nIf you work in a job that exposes you to latex, take advantage of all latex allergy education and training provided by your employer. Become familiar with procedures for preventing latex allergy. Learn the symptoms of latex allergy.\nUse nonlatex gloves for activities that are not likely to involve contact with infectious material (food preparation and housekeeping).\nIf latex gloves are used, powder-free gloves with reduced protein content may reduce the risk of developing an allergy to latex.\nWhen wearing latex gloves, do not use oil-based hand creams or lotions (which can cause glove deterioration).\nAfter removing latex gloves, wash hands with mild soap and dry them thoroughly.\n\nWhat should I do if I suspect I have a latex allergy?\n\nAvoid contact with latex products.\nBe evaluated by a physician experienced in diagnosing latex allergy.\n\nWhat are some things I can do to protect myself if I am allergic to latex?\n\nAvoid contact with natural rubber latex products.\nIf you have to wear gloves in your work, ask your employer for nonlatex gloves.\nAvoid areas where you might inhale the powder from latex gloves worn by other workers.\nWear a personal medical emergency ID bracelet.",
