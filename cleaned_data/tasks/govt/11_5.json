Learn more\nThe LCSA will not check \"establish parentage\" next to a child's name in item 1 on Page 1 if there's already a legal determination you are the child's legal parent. This means there's a judgment (final court order) that says you are the child's legal parent, you're married to the other parent, or you signed a Voluntary Declaration of Parentage or Paternity (VDOP).\nIf you think that is not correct and you are not the child's legal parent, talk to a lawyer or Family Law Facilitator as soon as possible to find out your options.
