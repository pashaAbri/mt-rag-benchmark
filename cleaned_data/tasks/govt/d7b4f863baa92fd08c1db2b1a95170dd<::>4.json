        "text": "A Different View of Home\nAstronomical units are roughly the distance from the Sun to the Earth: 150 million kilometers or 93 million miles.\nThe HI instrument observes the area just off the limb of the Sun (left) in order to detect the faintly visible light of the solar wind and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) as they blow out into the solar system. STEREO-B was on the far side of the Sun from the Earth, at about a 150 to 160 degree angle from the Earth-Sun line. Puffs of solar wind and from a CME are visible in a video made from the same images in March.\nIn the image and video, PanSTARRS and its tail are the bright, wide mass in the center of the image. A coronal mass ejection is developing on the Sun\u2019s limb (left), and Earth is to the right of the comet. The white dots in the background are stars. The vertical lines across the image are artifacts of the imager; the light of the comet, the Earth, and some planets and stars is too bright for an instrument trying to observe the faint light of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere.\nVideos of the comet and solar eruptions are available by clicking \r\nhere and here. To see the location of the satellites, comet, and planets, click here.\nImage by NASA/GSFC/STEREO.

        "text": "Facts About Earth - NASA Science\nEarth's vast oceans provided a convenient place for life to begin about 3.8 billion years ago.Some of the features of our planet that make it great for sustaining life are changing due to the ongoing effects of climate change.Size and DistanceWith an equatorial diameter of 7926 miles (12,760 kilometers), Earth is the biggest of the terrestrial planets and the fifth largest planet in our solar system.From an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), Earth is exactly one astronomical unit away from the Sun because one astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets' distances from the Sun.It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.Orbit and RotationAs Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it's added to is called a leap year.Earth's axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.MoonsEarth is the only planet that has a single moon.\u00a0Our Moon\u00a0is the brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet's wobble, which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.Earth sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks.",
