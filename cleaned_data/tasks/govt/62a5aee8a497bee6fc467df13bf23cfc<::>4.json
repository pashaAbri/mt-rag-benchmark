    "text": "The City of Monterey Park Water System gets its water from local groundwater, which is pumped from 12 City-owned wells. These wells have a total capacity of 20 million gallons per day (mgd) and reach a depth of up to 1,800 feet. They are located near the Rio Hondo, outside the city limits, in the Main San Gabriel groundwater basin. Monterey Park's water is supplied by the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, of which the city is a member. It's important to note that the City of Monterey Park does not own the Garvey Reservoir, and the water it contains is not stored for city use.",

Average use per person is 100-110 gallons per day.\t\n\n5.\nWhat is ground water?\n\r\nContrary to what a lot of people think, groundwater is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments that lie beneath the surface of the earth, much the way water fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge or towel. \t\n\n6.\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\n\r\nThe San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater. Thus, keeping our groundwater resource clean is vitally important to all of us. \t\n\n7.\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze. These products are not only hazardous to our health, but to our environment. By disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\t\n\n8.\nCan contaminated groundwater be cleaned up?\n\r\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. Communities whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the cost of providing the water to customers.",

It occurs when\u00a0these products are\u00a0disposed of improperly and seep\u00a0into the ground. \u00a0By disposing of these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to groundwater contamination.\n|user|: Can it be clean up?\n|assistant|: Yes, contaminated groundwater can be cleaned up, but it can be a time-consuming and expensive process. Communities whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the cost of providing the water to customers. It is far better to prevent contamination in the first place.\n|user|: What is it?\n|assistant|: Contrary to popular belief, groundwater is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Instead, water fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments beneath the Earth's surface, similar to how water saturates a sponge or towel. Only 3.5 percent of the water on Earth is fresh water suitable for drinking, and most of that, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers. One-third of the freshwater is found in the ground, known as groundwater.\n|user|: What are the suppliers for the city?"
