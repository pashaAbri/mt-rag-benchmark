  "gold_answer": "Volcanic eruptions can contribute to global warming. For instance, two major volcanic eruptions, El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991, pumped sulfur dioxide gas high into the atmosphere. The gas was converted into tiny particles that lingered for more than a year, reflecting sunlight and shading Earth\u2019s surface. Volcanic ash can also cause major disruptions to air traffic as was seen in Iceland in 2010. Additionally they can render lands around the volcano unusable for decades, be a major irritant to human health, and causing structures to fail due to the weight of the ash. Volcano eruptions disperse gas, liquids, and particles into the lower atmosphere. In the other hand,Although volcanoes are active around the world, and continue to emit carbon dioxide as they did in the past, the amount of carbon dioxide they release is extremely small compared to human emissions. On average, volcanoes emit between 130 and 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. By burning fossil fuels, people release in excess of 100 times more, about 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere every year (as of 2005)",

White areas indicate that fewer than two-thirds of the climate models agreed on how precipitation will change. Stippled areas reveal where more than 90 percent of the models agreed. (\u00a92007 IPCC WG1 AR-4.)\n\nIt is impossible to pin any single unusual weather event on global warming, but emerging evidence suggests that global warming is already influencing the weather. Heat waves, droughts, and intense rain events have increased in frequency during the last 50 years, and human-induced global warming more likely than not contributed to the trend.\nRising Sea Levels\nThe weather isn\u2019t the only thing global warming will impact: rising sea levels will erode coasts and cause more frequent coastal flooding. Some island nations will disappear. The problem is serious because up to 10 percent of the world\u2019s population lives in vulnerable areas less than 10 meters (about 30 feet) above sea level.\nBetween 1870 and 2000, the sea level increased by 1.7 millimeters per year on average, for a total sea level rise of 221 millimeters (0.7 feet or 8.7 inches). And the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Since 1993, NASA satellites have shown that sea levels are rising more quickly, about 3 millimeters per year, for a total sea level rise of 48 millimeters (0.16 feet or 1.89 inches) between 1993 and 2009.\n\nSea levels crept up about 20 centimeters (7.9 inches) during the twentieth century. Sea levels are predicted to go up between 18 and 59 cm (7.1 and 23 inches) over the next century, though the increase could be greater if ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica melt more quickly than predicted. Higher sea levels will erode coastlines and cause more frequent flooding. (Graph \u00a92007 Robert Rohde.)\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that sea levels will rise between 0.18 and 0.59 meters (0.59 to 1.9 feet) by 2099 as warming sea water expands, and mountain and polar glaciers melt.",

Accordingly to studies from 2022, that is tracking 30 years of sea level rise global has risen 101 millimeters (3.98 inches) since 1992, and it continues to do so at 3.9 mm (0.15 inches) per year. The globe is warming, ice is melting, factors that help the sea level to rise In addition, global sea level can fluctuate due to climate patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, which influence ocean temperature and global precipitation patterns. NASA has also been conducting airborne and ship-based campaigns such as Operation IceBridge and Oceans Melting Greenland to gather measurements of ice sheets and glaciers.

The problem is serious because up to 10 percent of the world\u2019s population lives coastal cities,  in vulnerable areas less than 10 meters (about 30 feet) above sea level. It can also impact ecosystems . Even NASA has been affected as half to two-thirds of its space infrastructure and assets stand within 5 meters of sea level. The acceleration of the rise of the sea level  has been driven mainly by increased ice melting in Greenland and Antarctica, and it has the potential to double the total sea level rise projected by 2100.\n|user|: climage change is fake\n|assistant|: Climate change is not fake.  In fact, the climate is influenced by the movement of heat and moisture by air and ocean currents, which can affect the temperatures, precipitation, humidity, soil moisture, surface water levels, groundwater levels, and even storm events of a particular region Climate change refers to long-term changes in the average weather patterns that define the Earth's global, regional and local climates. Said that global temperatures are rising and this is a global warming in face of the  higher sea levels and more intense storms, coastal communities facing greater risk of rapid beach erosion from destructive storms.Hotter summers and more frequent fires will lead to more cases of heat stroke and deaths, and to higher levels of near-surface ozone and smoke, which would cause more \u2018code red\u2019 air quality days. Intense droughts can lead to an increase in malnutrition. On a longer time scale, fresh water will become scarcer, especially during the summer, as mountain glaciers disappear, particularly in Asia and parts of North America.  All that scientists predicted, such as the loss of sea ice, melting glaciers and ice sheets, sea level rise, and more intense heat waves. It is true that Despite the amount of available scientific knowledge about the impacts of climate change happening now, and of new risks for the future, there is still a lack of understanding amongst the general public But indeed the  global warming with some exceptions is real, the tropics will likely receive less rain (orange) as the planet warms, while the polar regions will receive more precipitation (green).

One of the solutions is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases  investing in the development of innovative and pioneering technologies with the support of the state agencies, as well as consult with the environmental justice community, industry sectors, business groups, academic institutions, environmental organizations.

These sea level change predictions may be underestimates, however, because they do not account for any increases in the rate at which the world\u2019s major ice sheets are melting. As temperatures rise, ice will melt more quickly. Satellite measurements reveal that the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets are shedding about 125 billion tons of ice per year\u2014enough to raise sea levels by 0.35 millimeters (0.01 inches) per year. If the melting accelerates, the increase in sea level could be significantly higher.\nImpacting Ecosystems\nMore importantly, perhaps, global warming is already putting pressure on ecosystems, the plants and animals that co-exist in a particular climate zone, both on land and in the ocean. Warmer temperatures have already shifted the growing season in many parts of the globe. The growing season in parts of the Northern Hemisphere became two weeks longer in the second half of the 20th century. Spring is coming earlier in both hemispheres.\nThis change in the growing season affects the broader ecosystem. Migrating animals have to start seeking food sources earlier. The shift in seasons may already be causing the lifecycles of pollinators, like bees, to be out of synch with flowering plants and trees. This mismatch can limit the ability of both pollinators and plants to survive and reproduce, which would reduce food availability throughout the food chain.\nSee Buzzing About Climate Change to read more about how the lifecycle of bees is synched with flowering plants.\nWarmer temperatures also extend the growing season. This means that plants need more water to keep growing throughout the season or they will dry out, increasing the risk of failed crops and wildfires.",

      "text": "Sea Level Rise is Accelerating\n\u201cThis is almost certainly a conservative estimate,\u201d said Nerem, who is a member of NASA\u2019s Sea Level Change team. \u201cOur extrapolation assumes that sea level continues to change in the future as it has over the last 25 years. Given the large changes we are seeing in the ice sheets today, that is not likely.\u201d\nRising concentrations of greenhouse gases in Earth\u2019s atmosphere increase the temperature of air and water, which causes sea level to rise in two ways. First, warmer water expands, and this \u201cthermal expansion\u201d of the ocean has contributed about half of the 7 centimeters (2.8 inches) of global mean sea level rise that has been observed over the past 25 years, Nerem said. Second, the water from melting land ice flows into the ocean, which also increases sea level around the world.\nThe rate of sea level rise has risen from about 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inch) per year in the 1990s to about 3.4 millimeters (0.13 inches) per year today. These increases have been measured by satellite altimeters since 1992, including the TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1, Jason-2, and Jason-3 missions, which have been jointly managed by NASA, France\u2019s Centre national d'etudes spatiales (CNES), the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The maps on this page depict the changes in sea level observed by those satellites between 1992 and 2014.\n\n1992 - 2014PNG\n\n\u201cThe TOPEX/Poseidon/Jason altimetry missions have been essentially providing the equivalent of a global network of nearly half a million accurate tide gauges, providing sea surface height information every 10 days for over 25 years,\u201d said Brian Beckley of NASA Goddard. \u201cAs this climate data record approaches three decades, the fingerprints of Greenland and Antarctic land-based ice loss are now being revealed in the global and regional mean sea level estimates.\u201d\nEven with a 25-year data record, it can be challenging to detect acceleration. Episodes like volcanic eruptions can create variability; for instance, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 decreased global mean sea level just before the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite launch.",

We know this because scientists closely monitor the natural and human activities that influence climate with a fleet of satellites and surface instruments.\n\nRemote meteorological stations (left) and orbiting satellites (right) help scientists monitor the causes and effects of global warming.

Taken together, these measurements provide an ever-improving record of both natural events and human activity for the past 150 years.\nScientists integrate these measurements into climate models to recreate temperatures recorded over the past 150 years. Climate model simulations that consider only natural solar variability and volcanic aerosols since 1750\u2014omitting observed increases in greenhouse gases\u2014are able to fit the observations of global temperatures only up until about 1950. After that point, the decadal trend in global surface warming cannot be explained without including the contribution of the greenhouse gases added by humans.\nThough people have had the largest impact on our climate since 1950, natural changes to Earth\u2019s climate have also occurred in recent times. For example, two major volcanic eruptions, El Chichon in 1982 and Pinatubo in 1991, pumped sulfur dioxide gas high into the atmosphere. The gas was converted into tiny particles that lingered for more than a year, reflecting sunlight and shading Earth\u2019s surface.",

      "text": "April | 2012 | Terra\nI have helped initiate a rapid response program using data from MODIS and AVHRR to trigger emergency ASTER observations of volcanoes and other natural disasters.\u00a0 In addition to the satellite image analysis, the tools employed include laboratory-based infrared spectroscopy, field-based TIR imaging and differential global positioning system (dGPS) data collection. I have focused on the multispectral thermal IR data of ASTER in order to map composition and micron-scale roughness of volcanic surfaces. No other sensor can capture this information, which is important to a better understanding of the activity conditions present at active lava domes and flows.\nWhy is the study of volcanoes important?\nMR: Although volcanoes do not kill as many people as earthquakes or large tropical storms (more than 70,000 deaths from volcanic eruptions occurred last century compared to more than that in just one large earthquake), there are several important reasons to study them. The first is hazard mitigation \u2013 over a half a billion people live directly in harms way of typical volcanic activity. This number grows significantly when one considers the much larger (but more rare) eruptions that have happened over time. The second reason is that volcanism is a primary geologic process that has operated throughout most of the Earth\u2019s history (along with impact cratering). For a geologist, studying volcanoes can lead to important insights into the solid Earth processes that have operated over geologic time and are ongoing at depth under every active volcano.\nWhat are some effects of volcanic eruptions on the global climate?\nMR: I do not study the climate aspects of volcanic eruptions directly since I am more interested in the geology. However volcanoes can produce large amounts of carbon dioxide, water, and sulfur dioxide as well as ash.\u00a0 The first two are major greenhouse gases, which can impact climate change. Volcanic ash can cause major disruptions to air traffic (as was seen in Iceland in 2010), can render lands around the volcano unusable for decades, be a major irritant to human health, and can cause structures to fail due to the weight of the ash.\nVolcano eruptions disperse gas, liquids, and particles into the lower atmosphere.\u00a0 One of the expellants is sulfur dioxide (SO2.)\u00a0 What are the effects on the environment?",

Temperatures across the globe dipped for two to three years.\n\nAlthough Earth\u2019s temperature fluctuates naturally, human influence on climate has eclipsed the magnitude of natural temperature changes over the past 120 years. Natural influences on temperature\u2014El Ni\u00f1o, solar variability, and volcanic aerosols\u2014have varied approximately plus and minus 0.2\u00b0 C (0.4\u00b0 F), (averaging to about zero), while human influences have contributed roughly 0.8\u00b0 C (1\u00b0 F) of warming since 1889. (Graphs adapted from Lean et al., 2008.)\n\nAlthough volcanoes are active around the world, and continue to emit carbon dioxide as they did in the past, the amount of carbon dioxide they release is extremely small compared to human emissions. On average, volcanoes emit between 130 and 230 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. By burning fossil fuels, people release in excess of 100 times more, about 26 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere every year (as of 2005). As a result, human activity overshadows any contribution volcanoes may have made to recent global warming.\nChanges in the brightness of the Sun can influence the climate from decade to decade, but an increase in solar output falls short as an explanation for recent warming. NASA satellites have been measuring the Sun\u2019s output since 1978. The total energy the Sun radiates varies over an 11-year cycle. During solar maxima, solar energy is approximately 0.1 percent higher on average than it is during solar minima.\n\nThe transparent halo known as the solar corona changes between solar maximum (left) and solar minimum (right). (NASA Extreme Ultraviolet Telescope images from the SOHO Data Archive.)\n\nEach cycle exhibits subtle differences in intensity and duration.",
