      "text": "Local rent control laws. [Ballot]\nSeveral California cities\u2014including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Jose\u2014and some unincorporated communities have laws that limit how much landlords can increase rents for housing from one year to the next. These laws often are called rent control. About one-quarter of Californians live in communities with rent control. Local rent boards carry out rent control. These boards are paid for with fees on landlords.\nCourt Rulings Limit Local Rent Control.\u00a0Courts have ruled that rent control laws must allow landlords to receive a \u201cfair rate of return.\u201d This means that landlords must be allowed to increase rents enough to receive some profit each year.\nState Law Limits Local Rent Control.\u00a0A state law, known as the\u00a0Costa-Hawkins Rental Housing Act\u00a0(Costa-Hawkins), limits local rent control laws. Costa-Hawkins creates three main limitations. First, rent control cannot apply to any single-family homes. Second, rent control cannot apply to any newly built housing completed on or after February 1, 1995. Third, rent control laws cannot tell landlords what they can charge a new renter when first moving in.\nState Law Limits Rent Increases.\u00a0In addition to any local rent control laws in place as allowed by Costa-Hawkins, a more recent state law also limits rent increases for most rental housing in California. Landlords cannot increase rent by more than 5\u00a0percent plus inflation in a year, or 10\u00a0percent, whichever is lower. This applies to most housing that is more than 15 years old. This law lasts until January 1, 2030.\nState and Local Government Tax Revenues.\u00a0Three taxes are the largest sources of tax revenue for the state and local governments in California\u2014personal income tax, property tax, and sales tax. The state collects a personal income tax on income\u2014including rent received by landlords\u2014earned within the state. Local governments levy property taxes on property owners based on the value of their property. The state and local governments collect sales taxes on the retail sale of goods.\nProposal\nRepeals Costa-Hawkins. The measure repeals the limits on local rent control laws in Costa-Hawkins. Under the measure, cities and counties can regulate rents for any housing.",

This would increase their income tax payments. The overall effect on state income tax revenue is not clear.\n\nOverall, the measure likely would reduce state and local revenues over time. The largest effect would be on property taxes. The amount of revenue loss would depend on many factors, most importantly how communities respond to this measure. For example, if communities that already have rent control expand their rules to include newer homes and single-family homes, revenue losses could be in the high tens of millions of dollars per year. If many communities create new rent control rules, revenue losses could be larger. If few communities make changes, revenue losses would be more limited and dependent on the scope of rent control laws that automatically expanded in response to the repeal of Costa-Hawkins.\nIncreased Local Government Costs.\u00a0If cities or counties create new rent control laws or expand existing ones, local rent boards would have increased costs. For communities where rent control laws expand automatically, costs also could increase. Depending on local government choices, these costs could\u00a0range from very little to tens of millions of dollars per year. These costs likely would be paid by fees on owners of rental housing.\nSummary of Fiscal Effects. We estimate that this measure would have the following major fiscal effect:\n\nOverall, a potential reduction in state and local revenues in the high tens of millions of dollars per year over time. Depending on actions by local communities, revenue losses could be less or more.\n\nSubscribe\r\n | California State Legislature \r\n | Online Voter Registration\r\n | Privacy Policy\r\n | Accessibility\n\nLegislative Analyst's Office | The California Legislature's Nonpartisan Fiscal and Policy Advisor\r\n \r\n 925 L Street, Suite 1000 Sacramento, CA 95814 | (916) 445-4656 | information [at] lao.ca.gov",
