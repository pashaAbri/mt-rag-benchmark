But  the two spacecrafts most famous to reach Jupiter were Juno and Galileo. Juno began its circuitous five-year journey to Jupiter on August 5  of 2011 and it was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Florida\u2019s Atlantic coast . Juno mission completed its 50th close pass by Jupiter since its arrived at the big planet in 2016.  It is important to note that Juno is preparing the way for future visitors such as ESA\u2019s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.  Galileo mission to Jupiter had been authorized in October 1977 for a 1982 space shuttle launch, but there were some delays to the shuttle program, confusion over the development of an appropriate upper stage to send the probe on its way out of Earth orbit, and finally the loss of space shuttle Challenger and its crew in 1986, postponed Galileo's launch until 1989. Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.\n|user|: Could you tell me about the most important discoveries that Juno did in its way to Jupiter and also what it found in that huge planet?\n|assistant|:  NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno\u2019s transition into a full Jovian system explorer.Now in its extended mission, Juno will continue its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft\u2019s end of life. This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex.

That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .\n|user|: By the way, how are the cyclones on earth formed?\n|assistant|: Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?"

      "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nThe self-destruct maneuver would have satisfied NASA\u2019s planetary protection requirements, avoiding any chance Juno could crash into the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, or Callisto \u2013 ocean worlds, with Europa in particular considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth \u2013 and contaminate them with microscopic life from Earth.\u00a0\u00a0The Cassini mission, orbiting Saturn from 2004 to 2017, prompted similar concerns \u2013 protecting the integrity of Saturn\u2019s moons Enceladus and Titan, also believed to contain possibly habitable environments. As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno\u2019s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter\u2019s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere.\u00a0Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet.

The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?"

But how far? One of the most fundamental questions about the giant planet, scientists have debated that for decades. By measuring Jupiter\u2019s gravity field, Juno discovered that the belts and zones \u2013 which are alternating east- and west-flowing jet streams \u2013 extend about 1,900 miles (3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops.\u00a0\u00a0Scientists long thought Jupiter had a small, solid core surrounded by all its hydrogen and helium. Juno data suggests the core is much larger than expected, yet partially dissolved, with no clear separation from the hydrogen swirling around it, leading researchers to describe the core as dilute, or \u201cfuzzy.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Under extreme pressure, gases can turn into their liquid form. Inside Jupiter the atmospheric pressure is so great, it compresses hydrogen gas not merely into liquid, but a fluid known as liquid metallic hydrogen. This exaggerated pressure makes the liquid hydrogen act like a metal conducting electricity, and scientists believe it\u2019s the source of Jupiter\u2019s uniquely intense magnetic field. Years of Juno measurements of Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field point to that possibility, at a depth much shallower than expected.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before Juno arrived, the largest planet in our solar system still had vast areas unexplored, unknown, even unseen.

These cyclones stretch more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms don\u2019t merge.\u00a0During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region.",

      "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nPolar cyclones as large as Earth, plunging storm systems that travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on Earth, all tantalized scientists.\u00a0Previous spacecraft visiting Jupiter traveled more or less even with its equator \u2013 the same view of the planet that\u2019s visible from Earth. Juno was the first to fly over the north and south poles, a unique vantage point that accounts for many of the mission\u2019s surprises.\u00a0\u00a0Scientists discovered that the massive auroras undulating at Jupiter\u2019s poles seem to form by different processes than the northern lights and southern lights on Earth. Investigators also discovered that lightning storms, which on Earth are more common near the equator, are a polar phenomenon on Jupiter, where they drop softball-sized hailstones of ammonia and water.\u00a0A technical concern arose early in the mission, however \u2013 it changed Juno\u2019s timeline, and altered what it would accomplish during its time in orbit.\u00a0\u00a0Originally, the flight plan had Juno looping around Jupiter for a couple of 53-day orbits, then shrinking those orbits to 14 days for the remainder of the mission \u2013 spending about 15 months circling and studying the planet. But a problem in the main engine, with some valves not working as expected, troubled the Juno team; a misfire could prove disastrous. They decided to maintain the status quo of the longer orbits.\u00a0Each flyby of Jupiter would give Juno\u2019s instruments the same two-hour window to collect data, but they would come every seven weeks, instead of every two.\u00a0The new plan meant a much longer schedule to complete Juno\u2019s science goals. Then again, the wider orbits would allow for \u201cbonus science\u201d that wasn\u2019t part of the original mission design.\u00a0\u00a0The spacecraft could further explore the far reaches of space dominated by Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. And after it completed its initial goals, and NASA extended the mission, the Juno team realized that the long orbits would evolve to eventually put the planet\u2019s Galilean moons within reach.\u00a0On June 7, 2021, during orbit 34, Juno flew within 652 miles of Ganymede, Jupiter\u2019s largest moon (in fact, the largest moon in the solar system). It was the closest such encounter since the Galileo spacecraft flew by Ganymede in May 2000.",
