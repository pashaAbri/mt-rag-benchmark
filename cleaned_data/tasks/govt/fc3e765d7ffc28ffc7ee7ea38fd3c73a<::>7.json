Specifically, DFEH has responsibility for enforcing the state's main equal opportunity law, the Fair Employment and Housing Act, and resolving complaints in a timely manner.\nThe budget proposes expenditures of $22.4 million ($18.3 million from the General Fund and $4.1 million federal funds) for support of the department in 2001-02. This represents an increase\r\nof $363,000 (1.6 percent) over estimated current-year expenditures.\nInsufficient Justification of Increased Funding \nWe recommend the Legislature delete a total of $151,000 and two positions because the department has not provided workload information for the requested positions.\r\n(Delete $151,000 in Item 1700-001-0001.)\nNo Workload Data for Restrictive Covenant Program. The budget includes $151,000 from the General Fund for two positions to administer a new restrictive covenant identification\r\nservice, as authorized by Chapter 291, Statutes of 1999 (AB 1493, Nakano). Restrictive covenants under this program are those that limit property ownership based on race, color, religion,\r\nsex, familial status, marital status, disability, national origin, and ancestry, and violate the state's fair housing laws. Under this program, the department, upon request by property owners, reviews\r\nproperty deeds to determine if they contain racially restrictive covenants. According to the department, caseload tracking and processing will need to be developed for this activity. However,\r\nthe department has provided no workload data indicating the number of requests expected under the program or the amount of time it will take to process the requests. Until the department\r\nbegins administering the program, it is not clear that additional staff or resources are required. We recommend the department implement the program using existing resources during the budget\r\nyear and evaluate the workload during that time. If sufficient workload develops, a future request for staff and resources may be justified. Consequently, we recommend the Legislature delete\r\n$151,000 and two positions in Item 1700-001-0001.\n\nReturn to General Government Table of Contents,\r\n2001-02 Budget Analysis\n\n",

If you believe you have experienced housing discrimination, you can file a complaint with the Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH)."
