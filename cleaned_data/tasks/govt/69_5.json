  "gold_answer": "To script the sprite, create a new sprite by moving the mouse over Choose a sprite in the Sprite window and selecting Upload sprite. Choose the Mars fetch rover sprite image.  Then, you can use the available blocks in Scratch to create scripts that control the sprite's behavior. For example, make the sample tube sprites disappear when they are visited by the rover, or  reappear when players click the green flag to restart the game.  Use motion blocks to make the sprite move, turn, or change costumes. You can also use control blocks to add loops, conditionals, or variables to your scripts.",

Add a countdown timer NASA\u2019s missions to Mars and other destinations have a planned life expectancy. Some missions, including every Mars rover to date, have been extended and operated beyond their planned mission life expectancy, while others experience problems that shorten their mission. You can create a timer that counts down to the end of the mission and ends the game. Your timer should not be so short that the game is unplayable or unwinnable, but it should not be so long that there is no challenge to playing the game. As a bonus, you can create code to extend or shorten the planned mission time.\nTasks\n\nCreate a timer that counts from a set time down to zero. Hint: Create a Time variable that you can program to change. (See example image.)\nMake gameplay stop when the timer reaches zero.\nMake a \u201cMission Over\u201d message appear when the timer reaches zero.\nMake the timer start over when a player clicks the green flag to restart the game.\nBonus: Develop code that will increase or decrease the amount of time on the timer by one or two seconds at random.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n5. Add a scoring system Rover missions on Mars don\u2019t have a scoring system. But the science they collect is valuable, and some discoveries may be more exciting, interesting, or important than others. To determine how well players are doing while playing your game, you can develop a scoring system that includes points earned for collecting sample tubes. How points are totaled is up to you. You could also program your game to reduce point totals in certain scenarios (see Step 6, for example).\nTasks\n\nDevelop code to create a scoring system.\nIncrease the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n6. Add hazards Space travel and other worlds are fraught with hazards. From steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly. Program your game to include hazards that players need to avoid.",
