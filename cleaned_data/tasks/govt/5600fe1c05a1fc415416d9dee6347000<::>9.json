That light always beams onto Earth and Moon from the direction of the Sun, illuminating half of our planet in its orbit and reflecting off the surface of the Moon to create moonlight.Like Earth, the Moon has a day side and a night side, which change as the Moon rotates. The Sun always illuminates half of the Moon while the other half remains dark, but how much we are able to see of that illuminated half changes as the Moon travels through its orbit.This graphic shows the position of the Moon and the Sun during each of the Moon\u2019s phases and the Moon as it appears from Earth during each phase. Not to scale.NASA/JPL-CaltechLet\u2019s take a look at the individual phases, and how the movements of the Moon and Sun appear to us as we watch from the Northern Hemisphere on Earth:New MoonThis is the invisible phase of the Moon, with the illuminated side of the Moon facing the Sun and the night side facing Earth. In this phase, the Moon is in the same part of the sky as the Sun and rises and sets with the Sun. Not only is the illuminated side facing away from the Earth, it\u2019s also up during the day! Remember, in this phase, the Moon doesn\u2019t usually pass directly between Earth and the Sun, due to the inclination of the Moon\u2019s orbit. It only passes near the Sun from our perspective on Earth.Waxing CrescentThis silver sliver of a Moon occurs when the illuminated half of the Moon faces mostly away from Earth, with only a tiny portion visible to us from our planet. It grows daily as the Moon\u2019s orbit carries the Moon\u2019s dayside farther into view. Every day, the Moon rises a little bit later.First QuarterThe Moon is now a quarter of the way through its monthly journey and you see half of its illuminated side. People may casually call this a half moon, but remember, that\u2019s not really what you\u2019re witnessing in the sky. You\u2019re seeing just a slice of the entire Moon \u2015 half of the illuminated half.",

Remember to also use special filters over the lenses of cameras, telescopes, or binoculars when looking at the Sun. The only time during a solar eclipse when it\u2019s safe to look at the Sun without eclipse glasses is during the brief total phase of a total solar eclipse, when the Moon completely blocks the Sun\u2019s bright face. Ask an adult for help looking at the Sun.\n\nTotal solar eclipses happen somewhere around the world about once a year. But because the Moon casts a fairly small shadow, these eclipses can only be seen from a small area on Earth each time.\nOther things can also pass between us and the Sun and block some of its light. When this happens, it is called a transit. Different things like planets, comets, spacecraft, and even birds can transit the Sun.\n\nHow to Play\nThe goal of this game is to snap photos of eclipses and objects that transit the Sun. Here\u2019s how to play on your desktop:\n\nUse your cursor to center on objects passing in front of the Sun.\nPress the spacebar to take a picture.\nTo take a close-up picture you can zoom in and out using your laptop trackpad or scroll wheel on your mouse, or by pressing the W and S buttons on your keyboard.\nTo change the camera filter and get a different view of the Sun, press the A and D keys.\n\nCredit: NASA\n\nSince the Sun is very bright, transiting objects look like dark shapes. During the game, you might notice some objects are bigger than others. That\u2019s because the objects are different sizes and different distances from you. Objects that are far away, like Mercury, look smaller \u2014 even though Mercury is an entire planet that\u2019s even larger than the Moon. Objects that are closer to Earth \u2013 or even in Earth\u2019s atmosphere, like a plane \u2013 look bigger. Here are some examples from the real world:\n\nMercury can be seen crossing the face of the Sun at the bottom of this picture.

Be sure to follow these safety guidelines when viewing a solar eclipse.Quick FactsThe next total solar eclipse visible in the contiguous United States will be on Aug. 23, 2044.Lunar eclipses occur during the full moon phase, and solar eclipses occur during the new moon phase.We can't normally see the corona \u2013\u2014the Sun's outer atmosphere \u2014 because Sun's surface below it is so much brighter. But during a total solar eclipse, the corona emerges, offering unique opportunities to study it.An eclipse season is one of only two periods during each year when the Sun, the Moon and Earth are aligned, allowing eclipses to occur. Each season lasts about 35 days and repeats just short of six months later!Featured StoryThe April 8 Total Solar Eclipse: Through the Eyes of NASAOn April 8, 2024, the Moon\u2019s shadow swept across North America, treating millions to a breathtaking view of a total\u2026Read the StorySafetyCitizen ScienceEclipse TypesScienceHistoryEye Safety During an EclipseObserving our star, the Sun, can be safe and inspirational.Except for a specific and brief period of time during a total solar eclipse, you must never look directly at the Sun without proper eye protection, such as safe solar viewing glasses (eclipse glasses). Eclipse glasses are NOT the same as regular sunglasses; regular sunglasses are not safe for viewing the Sun. During a total solar eclipse, you must wear your eclipse glasses (or use other solar filters) to view the Sun directly during the partial eclipse phase. You can only take your glasses off during the short time when the Moon completely obscures the Sun \u2013 known as the period of totality. If you don\u2019t have eclipse glasses, you can use an indirect viewing method, such as a pinhole projector, which projects an image of the Sun onto a nearby surface.It is safe to look at the Moon with unprotected eyes or through a telescope during all types and during all stages of a lunar eclipse.Learn MoreA family wearing eclipse glasses watches the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017.",

However, it's important to note that looking directly at the Moon during a lunar eclipse is generally considered safe. The concern with solar eclipses is that looking directly at the Sun can cause serious eye damage, which is why special precautions are needed. With a lunar eclipse, the Moon is in the Earth's shadow, so there's no risk of direct exposure to the Sun's harmful rays."
