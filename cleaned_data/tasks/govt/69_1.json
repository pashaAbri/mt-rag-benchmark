  "gold_answer": "You have the flexibility to determine how points are totaled in your game's scoring system. You could, for example, increase the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected. However, it does not provide specific details on how to total the points. Therefore, you can choose a method that best fits your game design.",

Add a countdown timer NASA\u2019s missions to Mars and other destinations have a planned life expectancy. Some missions, including every Mars rover to date, have been extended and operated beyond their planned mission life expectancy, while others experience problems that shorten their mission. You can create a timer that counts down to the end of the mission and ends the game. Your timer should not be so short that the game is unplayable or unwinnable, but it should not be so long that there is no challenge to playing the game. As a bonus, you can create code to extend or shorten the planned mission time.\nTasks\n\nCreate a timer that counts from a set time down to zero. Hint: Create a Time variable that you can program to change. (See example image.)\nMake gameplay stop when the timer reaches zero.\nMake a \u201cMission Over\u201d message appear when the timer reaches zero.\nMake the timer start over when a player clicks the green flag to restart the game.\nBonus: Develop code that will increase or decrease the amount of time on the timer by one or two seconds at random.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n5. Add a scoring system Rover missions on Mars don\u2019t have a scoring system. But the science they collect is valuable, and some discoveries may be more exciting, interesting, or important than others. To determine how well players are doing while playing your game, you can develop a scoring system that includes points earned for collecting sample tubes. How points are totaled is up to you. You could also program your game to reduce point totals in certain scenarios (see Step 6, for example).\nTasks\n\nDevelop code to create a scoring system.\nIncrease the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n6. Add hazards Space travel and other worlds are fraught with hazards. From steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly. Program your game to include hazards that players need to avoid.",

From steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly.

Add landing code Every Mars rover has to first land on the Red Planet before it can start exploring. You can specify a landing site by creating scripts that place the rover at a certain location at the beginning of the game.Tasks Create code that puts the rover in a specific location at the beginning of the game. Bonus: Modify your landing code to make the rover land in a random location on the backdrop image or in a random location within a smaller section of the backdrop image.About the image: This animated image is a clip from a video taken by the Perseverance rover mission as the rover was being lowered onto the surface of Mars. \u203a Full video and caption\n\n8.
