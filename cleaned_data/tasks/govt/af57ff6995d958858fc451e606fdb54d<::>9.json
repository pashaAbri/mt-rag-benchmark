    "original_text": "In California, the state procurement process is managed by the Department of General Services (DGS). The DGS Procurement Division is responsible for managing the state's procurement activities, including developing policies, procedures, and guidelines for procurement. The DGS also maintains a statewide contracting system, which provides a centralized location for state agencies to access contracts for goods and services. Additionally, the DGS offers training and certification programs for procurement professionals.\nFor products related directly to the Highway System, Caltrans has a Product Evaluation Program (PEP) to evaluate and approve products for use on California's highways.\nCaltrans also encourages prospective contractors and vendors to consider programs and preferences available to Small Business (SBs), Disabled Veteran Enterprises (DVBEs), and other businesses covered by state programs. The Military Department is committed to providing contracting opportunities to a diverse variety of suppliers in their communities."
