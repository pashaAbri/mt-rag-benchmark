DEC regulations prohibit boats from launching or leaving sites without first draining the boat and cleaning the boat, trailer and equipment. Furthermore, many New York counties, towns, and villages also have laws in place that prohibit the transport of aquatic invasive species on boats, trailers and equipment.To avoid spreading invasive species, follow the 'Clean.Drain.Dry.' method for properly disinfecting your boat and equipment before launching. If you need help, many public boat launches have boat stewards on-site to inspect your watercraft and gear.Use our interactive map feature to locate a boat inspection station and boat steward near you.Certificate Requirements for Boating in the Adirondack Park: As of June 2022, all boaters operating any kind of motorized watercraft in the Adirondack Park and within ten miles of the Blue Line are required by law to possess certification that their vessel has undergone the proper cleaning measures to prevent the spread of aquatic invasive species. Boaters can get their certification from a boat steward at a DEC designated inspection station or by completing a self-issued certificate (PDF) prior to launch.
