  "gold_answer": "Yes, prions are known to be very stable and persistent in the environment.  It can survive in the environment for 10+ years, and can be absorbed by roots and distributed in growing forage,  able to infect susceptible deer or elk.  This makes chronic wasting disease (CWD) a challenging disease to control and eradicate.",

      "text": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a sporadic prion disease arising in 1:1,000,000 people, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has been linked to the consumption of infected cattle during the \u201cmad cow disease\u201d outbreak in Great Britain and Europe in the 1990s, are examples of TSEs in humans.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease spread?\n\nThe misfolded prion that causes CWD is infectious to other cervids and can be spread through direct contact with infected individuals or through contact with a contaminated environment. Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34\u00a0states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces. It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.\u00a0For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?",

However, the document neither provides specific information on why some states report more West Nile cases than others nor where these states are located.  It is recommended to check the CDC website or contact your local health department for the most recent and detailed data.\n|user|: when was the first time it discovered?\n|assistant|: The West Nile virus was first discovered in the United States in 1999. \n|user|: I mean historically.\n|assistant|: Sorry but the document does not provide an answer to your question.\n|user|: well, that is ok...but why you cannot answer to such seemingly an elementary question?\n|assistant|: I apologize for the confusion.  The document only mentions that it was first discovered in the United States in 1999, and it does not provide information about the discovery of the virus before that.\n|user|: animal infected diseases\n|assistant|: The document discusses several infectious diseases that can affect animals, including chronic wasting disease (CWD), plague, and West Nile virus. CWD is a slow-progressing neurological disease that affects deer, elk, and moose, and is caused by a misfolded prion protein. Plague is a severe bacterial infection that can affect humans and other mammals, and is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected flea or by handling infected animals. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause fever, headache, and muscle weakness in humans, and can also infect birds, horses, and other animals.\n|user|: are these regionally affected?\n|assistant|: Yes, these animal infectious diseases are regionally affected. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34 states and four Canadian provinces. West Nile virus has been reported in nearly 44,000 cases in the United States since 1999, with some states reporting more cases than others. Plague is most commonly found in the western United States, particularly in rural areas. Regarding the regional distribution of CWD, it was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967.  Additionally, it has been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.  \n|user|: With warming trend, West Niles virus can survive winter and more spreads in singht?\n|assistant|: Global warming could potentially affect the spread of West Nile virus. With warming trends, it is possible that the virus could survive winter more easily and potentially spread more widely. However, the document does not explicitly confirm this.\n|user|: our evironment is getting worse...scary!\n|assistant|: I understand that you might be concerned about the effects of global warming on infectious diseases like West Nile virus. It's true that warming temperatures can have various impacts on ecosystems and the spread of certain diseases.  The average global temperature on Earth has increased by at least 1.1\u00b0 Celsius (1.9\u00b0 Fahrenheit) since 1880 and has nearly doubled in the last 50 years.\n|user|: heard prion protain is very persistant"
