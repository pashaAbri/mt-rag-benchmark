The 2000-01 budget contained $39 million for two components of EHAP:\n\nOperating Grants. $14 million of the funds are available to fund the ongoing services of homeless shelters. This level of funding\r\nis again proposed for 2001-02.\nCapital Loans. Forgivable loans totaling $25 million are available for the construction, rehabilitation, or acquisition of shelter\r\nfacilities.\n\nOther Programs \nCode Enforcement Incentives. Two new programs\u2014designed to improve local enforcement of building codes\u2014were created by\r\nChapter 664, Statutes of 2000 (AB 1382, Lowenthal), and appropriated $5 million in one-time funds. The department has received\r\nabout $30 million in applications for the two programs.\n\nCode Enforcement Incentive Program. This program ($2.75 million) provides three-year grants to local jurisdictions to\r\nincrease staffing for local code enforcement activities. The maximum grant amount is $1 million, and local matching funds must\r\nincrease over the life of the grant.\n Community Code Enforcement Pilot Program. This program ($2.25 million), with a maximum grant amount of $450,000,\r\nemphasizes improving cooperation between code enforcement officials and prosecution agencies, health departments, housing\r\nagencies, and schools.\n\nInterregional Partnership Pilot Program. This program, funded at $5 million, will provide grants to assist local governments\r\nundertaking interregional planning for housing and employment issues, with a particular emphasis on improving geographic mapping.\nChild Care Facilities. The budget appropriated $16 million for the Child Care Facilities Financing Program. The funds can be\r\nused for either direct loans or loan guarantees for child care facility purchases, expansions, or renovations. In the 2000-01 Analysis,\r\nwe reported that the program was having administrative difficulties in distributing $7 million in funds appropriated in the 1997-98\r\nbudget.",
