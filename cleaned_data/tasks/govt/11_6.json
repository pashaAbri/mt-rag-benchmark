  "input": "  Is a jail sentence given for a child support conviction?",
  "gold_answer": "The documents do not specify jail sentences, but you can opt for the Division of Child Support Services (DCSS) to enforce your support orders. They can issue administrative orders such as suspending the other parent's driver's license, intercepting tax refunds, or placing liens on bank accounts. In cases of willful failure to pay child support, DCSS may file contempt charges against the other parent. The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) is the federal agency responsible for administering the nationwide child support program. Offset refers to the money taken from a parent's state or federal income tax refund or an administrative payment, like federal retirement benefits, to pay a child support debt.",

Because a case may be heard by 3 or more judges in the appellate court, the opinion in appellate decisions can take several forms. If all the judges completely agree on the result, 1 judge will write the opinion for all. If all the judges do not agree, the formal decision will be based on the majority view, and 1 member of the majority will write the opinion. The judges that do not agree with the majority may write their own dissenting or concurring opinions to state their views. A dissenting opinion disagrees with the majority opinion because of the reasoning and/or the principles of law the majority used to decide the case. A concurring opinion agrees with the decision of the majority opinion, but offers comment or clarification or a completely different reason for reaching the same result. Only the majority opinion can be used as binding precedent in future cases.
