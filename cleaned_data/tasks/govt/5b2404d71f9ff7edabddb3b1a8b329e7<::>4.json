    "text": " Although I don't have the exact information about which state has more wildfires, it is known that the 2018 wildfire season in California was the deadliest and most destructive on record in the state. In the 2020 California wildfire season, record-setting wildfires burned across the state, with nearly 10,000 fires burning over 4.2 million acres by the end of the year. This accounted for more than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season in California's modern history. The August Complex fire, part of the 2020 wildfire year, has been described as the first \"gigafire\" due to the area burned exceeding 1 million acres. This fire spread across seven counties and was larger than the state of Rhode Island.",

        "text": "2020 Fire Season Incident Archive | CAL FIRE\nThe 2020 California wildfire year was characterized by record-setting wildfires that burned across the state of California as measured during the modern era of wildfire management and record keeping. As of the end of the year, nearly 10,000 fires had burned over 4.2 million acres, more than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history. California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\" as the area burned exceeded 1 million acres. The fire crossed seven counties and has been described as being larger than the state of Rhode Island. On August 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16\u201317. In early September 2020, a combination of a record-breaking heat wave, and Diablo and Santa Ana winds sparked more fires and explosively grew the active fires, with the August Complex more than doubling the Mendocino Complex's size to become California's largest recorded wildfire.\n\nPictured: The LNU Lightning Complex which burned across wine country in August 2020.\n\nincidents by year\n\nACTIVE\u00a0\n2023\u00a0\n2022\u00a0\n2021\u00a0\n2019\u00a0\n2018\u00a0\n2017\u00a0\n2016\u00a0\n\nQuick Links\n\nCurrent Incidents\n\n2024 Incidents\n\nDefensible Space\n\nExecutive Staff\n\nResources\n\nStatistics\n\nSubscribe to Newsletter\n\n2024 Strategic Plan\n\nPrograms\n\nBoard of Forestry and Fire Protection\n\nCommunications\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity\n\nFire and Resource Assessment Program\n\nFire Protection\n\nNatural Resource Management\n\nOffice of the State Fire Marshal\n\nProfessional Standards Program\n\nGrants\n\nBusiness and Workforce Development\n\nCalifornia Forest Improvement Program\n\nForest Health\n\nForest Legacy\n\nUrban and Community Forestry\n\nWildfire Prevention\n\nTribal Wildfire Resilience\n\nWildfire Resilience\n\nBack to Top\nAccessibility\nLanguage Access\nConditions of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nSite Map\nGlossary of Terms\n\n\r\n Copyright \u00a9 2024 State of California\r\n \n\nBack to top",

However, states like California, Texas, and Colorado often experience a high number of wildfires due to their climates and vegetation. I recommend checking the latest data from a reliable source such as the National Interagency Fire Center or the US Forest Service."
