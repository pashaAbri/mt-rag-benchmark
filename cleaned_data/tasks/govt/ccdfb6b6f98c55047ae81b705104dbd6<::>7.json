Formally started in NASA's FY 1994 \rbudget, the Discovery program featured small planetary exploration\rspacecraft with focused science goals that could be built in\r36 months or less, for less than $190 million in development costs \rand a total mission cost of less than $299 million. The program has \rexpanded since then, but still concentrates on smaller missions that \rrequire less resources and shorter development times than the larger \r\"flagship\" missions. \r\rThe program encourages the use of new technologies, transfer of these \rtechnologies to the private sector, increased participation of small \rand disadvantaged businesses, the pursuit of innovative ways of doing \rbusiness, and support of the nation's educational initiatives. \rThe objective is to perform high-quality scientific investigations \rwhich will assure continuity in the U.S. solar system exploration \rprogram and enhance general public awareness of, and appreciation \rfor, solar system exploration.\r\r\rSeventeen missions have been selected for the Discovery program so far:\r DAVINCI+ \r- Venus orbiter and atmospheric probe (to be launched 2028-2030) VERITAS \r- Venus orbiter (to be launched 2028-2030) Psyche \r- Asteroid Psyche orbiter (to be launched August 2022) Lucy \r- Trojan asteroid flyby mission (launched 16 October 2021) InSight \r- Mars geophysical lander (launched 5 May 2018) GRAIL A\rand \r\rGRAIL B \r- Lunar gravity orbiters (launched 10 September 2011) Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter \r- Lunar surface studies orbiter (launched 18 June 2009) Kepler \r- Exoplanet observation mission (launched 7 March 2009) Dawn \r- Asteroid Vesta and Ceres orbiter (launched 27 September 2007) Deep Impact \r- Mission to Comet Tempel 1 (launched 12 January 2005) MESSENGER \r- Mission to orbit Mercury (launched 3 August 2004) CONTOUR \r- Mission to fly by three comet nuclei (launched 3 July 2002 - failed) Genesis \r- Solar wind sample return mission (launched 8 August 2001) Stardust",

These observations will be used to determine the nature of the unknown ultraviolet absorber in\u00a0Venus\u2019 atmosphere\u00a0that absorbs up to half the incoming solar energy.\nEstablished in 1992, NASA\u2019s Discovery Program has supported the development and implementation of over 20 missions and instruments. These selections are part of the ninth Discovery Program competition.\nThe concepts were chosen from proposals submitted in 2019 under NASA Announcement of Opportunity NNH19ZDA010O. The selected investigations will be managed by the Planetary Missions Program Office at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, as part of the Discovery Program. The Discovery Program conducts space science investigations in the Planetary Science Division of NASA\u2019s Science Mission Directorate.
