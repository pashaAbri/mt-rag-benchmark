They often combine new technology with old tricks to get people to send money or give out personal information. \u00a0Don\u2019t be fooled \u2013 \u201cIf it\u2019s too good to be true, it probably is.\u201d If you experience a scam, report it to the Danville Police Department and to the Federal Trade Commission using the following link: \u00a0Federal Trade Commission\u00a0 Your reports help the FTC and other law enforcement investigate scams and bring crooks to justice.\n\n \n \n \n\nCommon Phone and Mail Schemes Occurring in The AreaIncarcerated Relative Scam:\u00a0The victim receives a phone call from someone claiming a relationship to them; usually grandchild, child or sibling. The caller will indicate that the \"relative\" has been involved in some type of law enforcement interaction such as a car crash or an arrest. The caller requests funds for bail, an attorney or perhaps insurance deductible fees.Please verify the relationship with actual family members! Do not be pressured into wiring money without verification. Wired transactions that are not halted within the first 15-30 minutes are usually non-reversible causing the victim to be out of pocket of any funds wired. The callers can be very convincing and often target older adults and senior citizens.Computer Repair / Microsoft Scam:\u00a0Computer repair scams are on the rise, and unsuspecting citizens can fall prey to these smooth talking sales pitches if they are uninformed. This scam occurs when someone gets an email or most often a phone call and the caller begins speaking very quickly about common computer issues that slow performance or even potential hacks to your system. The high pressure tactics are designed to convince you that they need immediate access to your PC to make urgent repairs to your operating system or to stop a hack already in progress.Some of these callers even claim to be from or affiliated with Microsoft in an effort to legitimize their scam.",

        "text": "Fraud and scam answers | Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\nForeclosure relief and mortgage loan modification scams are schemes to take your money or your house\u2014often by making a false promise of saving you from foreclosure. These scammers may ask for money upfront and claim to guarantee that you can get your mortgage terms changed. If you\u2019re having trouble making mortgage payments, a HUD-approved housing counseling agency can walk you through your options for free.\n\n Fraud alert for prevention\n \n\nA fraud alert is something you can use to reduce the likelihood that you will be the victim of new account identity theft. It requires creditors who check your credit report to take steps to verify your identity before opening a new account, issuing an additional card, or increasing the credit limit on an existing account. When you place a fraud alert on your credit report at one of the nationwide credit reporting companies, the company must notify the others.There are two main types of fraud alerts: initial fraud alerts and extended alerts. Members of the military have an additional option available to them\u2014active duty alerts, which give service members protection while they are on active duty. Read more.\n\n Fraud by fiduciaries\n \n\nA fiduciary is someone who manages someone else\u2019s money or property. For example, agents under a power of attorney and court-appointed guardians are fiduciaries.When you are named a fiduciary, you are required by law to manage the person\u2019s money and property for his or her benefit, not yours. When a fiduciary spends the money for his or her own benefit, that may be fraud.\n\n Identity theft\n \n\nIdentity theft occurs when someone steals your identity to commit fraud.Stealing your identity could mean using personal information without your permission, such as your name, Social Security number, bank account information, or credit card number. The Federal Trade Commission offers information about preventing and responding to identify theft.\n\n Imposter scams\n \n\nImposter scammers try to convince you to send money by pretending to be someone you know or trust like a sheriff, local, state, or federal government employee, or charity organization. Remember, caller ID can be faked. You can always call the organization or government agency and ask if the person works for them before giving any money.",
