Exploring this ocean world with our Europa Clipper spacecraft could provide new clues in our search for life beyond Earth.

Beyond Earth, Europa is considered one of the most promising currently habitable environments in our solar system. \nBelow Europa\u2019s icy surface, evidence suggests there is a global ocean with more water than all of Earth\u2019s oceans combined.
