However, if you lost temporary certificates, the temporary certificates cannot be replaced. If you are within 7 days of your temporary certificate\u2019s expiration date and have not yet received your card, you are advised to email [boating@parks.ny.gov](mailto:boating@parks.ny.gov). However, please note that NYS can only issue replacement certificates for the NY Safe Boating Course.\n|user|: do I have to have Boating safety certificates ?\n|assistant|: In New York, certain individuals are required to have a boating safety certificate. Specifically, anyone operating a Personal Watercraft (JetSki\u2122, Wave Runner\u2122, etc.) must have a boating safety certificate and be at least 14 years of age or older. Starting in 2024, if you are operating any other type of motorized boat, you will need a safety certificate if you were born on or after January 1, 1978. Starting in 2025, all operators of motorized vessels, regardless of age, will be required to have a safety certificate. However, if you are renting a boat, you do not need a safety certificate if you are at least 18 years old, although the livery must demonstrate how to properly use the boat before renting it. Persons under the age of 18 may only rent a motorboat if they hold a safety certificate.\n|user|: I need to register my boat and boat trailer\n|assistant|: You can either register your boat online or call the DMV at (518) 486-9786. Note that if your boat is powered by a motor (electric or fuel-driven), it must be registered, regardless of the size of the craft or the motor.\n|user|: Can I use my NY safety certificate in other states?\n|assistant|: Yes, the New York Safe Boating Certificate is nationally accredited and valid in other states and Canada. However, the Adventure License is not acceptable proof of a safe boating certificate outside of New York State.\n|user|: how much is the class and what type of payment do you accept?"
