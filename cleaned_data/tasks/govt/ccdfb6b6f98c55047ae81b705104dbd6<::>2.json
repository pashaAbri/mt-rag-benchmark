  "gold_answer": "The goal of the Deep Impact mission was to rendezvous with comet 9P/Tempel 1 and launch a projectile into the comet nucleus. Observations were then made of the ejecta, crater formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly the newly exposed surface. The mission aimed to improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus, determine properties of the surface layers, study the relationship between the surface layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior, and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy.",

Observations were made of the ejecta, much of which represented pristine material from the interior of the comet, the crater formation process, the resulting crater, and outgassing from the nucleus, particularly the newly exposed surface. The scientific objectives of the mission are to: improve the knowledge of the physical characteristics of cometary nuclei and directly assess the interior of cometary nucleus; determine properties of the surface layers such as density, strength, porosity, and composition from the crater and its formation; study the relationship between the surface layers of a cometary nucleus and the possibly pristine materials of the interior by comparison of the interior of the crater with the surface before impact; and improve our understanding of the evolution of cometary nuclei, particularly their approach to dormancy, by comparing the interior and the surface. This project was selected as a Discovery class mission in July, 1999. After the primary mission, Deep Impact was selected for a two-part extended mission designated EPOXI.\n\nSpacecraft and Subsystems\n\nThe spacecraft consists of a 370 kg cylindrical copper impactor attached to a 650 kg flyby bus. The spacecraft is a box-shaped honeycomb aluminum framework with a flat rectangular Whipple debris shield mounted on one side to protect components during comet close approach. Body mounted on the framework are one high- and one medium-resolution instrument, each of which consists of an imaging camera and an infrared spectrometer which will be used to observe the ejected ice and dust, much of which will be exposed to space for the first time in over 4 billion years. The medium resolution camera has a field of view (FOV) of 0.587 degrees and a resolution of 7 m/pixel at 700 km distance and is used for navigation and context images. The high resolution camera has a FOV of 0.118 degrees and a resolution of 1.4 m/pixel at 700 km.",
