Rapid-results testing is being expanded but has limited availability. The vast majority of test sites send the samples to a lab off-site, like Quest or LabCorp, and results generally take two to 12 days because it takes time to ship the samples, and time for the labs to process the tests.

They are a type of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), which are more likely to detect the virus than antigen tests. Your sample will usually be taken by a healthcare provider and transported to a laboratory for testing. It may take up to 3 days to receive results.\nAntigen Tests\nAntigen tests* are rapid tests that usually produce results in 15-30 minutes. Positive results are accurate and reliable. However, in general, antigen tests are less likely to detect the virus than PCR tests, especially when symptoms are not present. Therefore, a single negative antigen test cannot rule out infection. To be confident you do not have COVID-19, FDA recommends 2 negative antigen tests for individuals with symptoms or 3 antigen tests for those without symptoms, performed 48 hours apart. A single PCR test can be used to confirm an antigen test result.\n\n*Self-tests, or at-home tests, are antigen tests that can be taken anywhere without having to go to a specific testing site. Read self-test package inserts thoroughly and follow the instructions closely when performing the test.\nTop of PageChoosing a COVID-19 Test\nI want to get tested and:\nI have not had COVID-19 or I have not had a positive test within the past 90 days.You may choose a PCR or antigen test.\nIf you use an antigen test and your result is negative, repeat testing following FDA recommendations.\nI tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 90 days.My first positive test result was within:30 days or less\n\nI have symptoms\nUse an antigen test.
