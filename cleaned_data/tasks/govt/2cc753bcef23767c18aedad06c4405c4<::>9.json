Republic Services has an exclusive franchise for the removal of solid waste and recyclable material from properties within the City limits.\n Q: May I self-haul the debris? \n A: Contractors, or any other paid hauler other than Republic Services, cannot remove the debris for the homeowner.

Applicants are encouraged to salvage and reuse materials and fixtures such as bricks, windows, light fixtures, porcelain fixtures, fireplace mantles and more per the attached Salvaged Material Form (SMF).

    "original_text": "If you plan to remodel your house and generate construction and demolition (C&D) debris, you are required to divert at least 65% of the debris from going to a landfill according to the City of Piedmont's regulations. There are no additional City fees associated with this requirement. However, you are required to use Republic Services to haul recyclable and non-recyclable debris, except if you personally transport the debris to the solid waste and/or recycling facility. You are also encouraged to salvage and reuse materials and fixtures to help meet the diversion goal. If more than 65% of the debris generated is not recyclable, you should still aim to divert 65% of the debris by weighing and documenting the reused or salvaged materials.\nRegarding your question about moving debris yourself, contractors or any other paid haulers cannot remove the debris for you, but homeowners who do not pay to have debris removed are exempt from the exclusive franchise agreement with Republic Services. Therefore, if you choose to remove and transport the debris yourself, you can do so without violating the agreement. However, you should ensure that you follow all relevant laws and regulations related to waste disposal and handling."
