Add a countdown timer NASA\u2019s missions to Mars and other destinations have a planned life expectancy. Some missions, including every Mars rover to date, have been extended and operated beyond their planned mission life expectancy, while others experience problems that shorten their mission. You can create a timer that counts down to the end of the mission and ends the game. Your timer should not be so short that the game is unplayable or unwinnable, but it should not be so long that there is no challenge to playing the game. As a bonus, you can create code to extend or shorten the planned mission time.\nTasks\n\nCreate a timer that counts from a set time down to zero. Hint: Create a Time variable that you can program to change. (See example image.)\nMake gameplay stop when the timer reaches zero.\nMake a \u201cMission Over\u201d message appear when the timer reaches zero.\nMake the timer start over when a player clicks the green flag to restart the game.\nBonus: Develop code that will increase or decrease the amount of time on the timer by one or two seconds at random.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n5. Add a scoring system Rover missions on Mars don\u2019t have a scoring system. But the science they collect is valuable, and some discoveries may be more exciting, interesting, or important than others. To determine how well players are doing while playing your game, you can develop a scoring system that includes points earned for collecting sample tubes. How points are totaled is up to you. You could also program your game to reduce point totals in certain scenarios (see Step 6, for example).\nTasks\n\nDevelop code to create a scoring system.\nIncrease the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n\n+ Expand image\n\n6. Add hazards Space travel and other worlds are fraught with hazards. From steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly. Program your game to include hazards that players need to avoid.",

You could, for example, increase the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected. However, it does not provide specific details on how to total the points. Therefore, you can choose a method that best fits your game design.\n|user|: any sample setting?\n|assistant|: There is no specific sample setting provided. However, for the Mars Sample Collection Video Game, you are encouraged to study the backdrop images closely and identify areas that look interesting to place sample tubes in those spots.  Develop code to create a scoring system. Increase the score by one or more points for each sample tube collected.\n|user|: How to make the game interesting \n|assistant|: To make the game more interesting, you can consider adding various features such as: 1.  Increase the complexity of the terrain or add more hazards from steep slopes and deep sand to sharp rocks and high radiation, there are countless ways a mission can be delayed or end unexpectedly.  2. Specify a landing site by creating scripts that place the rover at a certain location at the beginning of the game.  3.  Let others play it and suggest improvements.\n|user|: sprite the sprite of bevarage?\n|assistant|: It seems like there might be a typo in your question.  A Mars fetch rover sprite is a sample collection tube.  \n|user|: Of course I knew it!  just teasing, sorry.  How to scripts sprite?\n|assistant|: To script the sprite, create a new sprite by moving the mouse over Choose a sprite in the Sprite window and selecting Upload sprite. Choose the Mars fetch rover sprite image.  Then, you can use the available blocks in Scratch to create scripts that control the sprite's behavior. For example, make the sample tube sprites disappear when they are visited by the rover, or  reappear when players click the green flag to restart the game.  Use motion blocks to make the sprite move, turn, or change costumes. You can also use control blocks to add loops, conditionals, or variables to your scripts.\n|user|: other games?\n|assistant|: There are several other games available on the NASA Space Place website that you might find interesting. Here are some of them: 1. Snap it! An Eclipse Photo Adventure - Help the Traveler snap photos of an eclipse!  2. Play Helios: A Game About How the Sun Makes Energy! - Where does the Sun's energy come from?  3. Space Volcanoes! - Explore the many volcanoes in our solar system using the Space Volcano Explorer. 4. Go With the Flow: An Ocean Currents Game - In this ocean currents game, use heat and salt to float your sub to the treasure! 5. Write your own zany adventure story!  6. Play Solar System Switch-a-Roo! - Put clues together to find the planets and moons. 7. DSN Uplink-Downlink: A DSN Game - Help the big antennas gather data from the spacecraft. 8. Roman Space Observer - Catch as many astrophysical objects and phenomena as possible in this game! 9. CubeSat Builder: Build a NASA Spacecraft!  10. Scope It Out! - Scope It Out! includes an introduction to telescopes and two matching games. You can access these games through the NASA Space Place website.\n|user|: Do they use guns?  "

You will use mirrors to move the laser and avoid obstacles to get the data back to Earth. Each level has new challenges and your ultimate goal is to build a communication network and synchronize, or match, the time on atomic clocks.\n\nAbout the mission\nOptical communication uses lasers to send data with a type of light that we can\u2019t see, called infrared light. Since the 1950s, NASA missions have used a different type of waves, called radio waves, to send data to and from space. With current radio wave communications, it takes about nine weeks to send a complete map of Mars back to Earth. With lasers, it only takes about nine days!\nOptical communication is very useful for space missions because data can be sent faster and more securely. Optical communication systems are also smaller, weigh less, and use less power. A smaller size means more room for science instruments, and using less power means less of a drain of the spacecraft\u2019s batteries. These are all very important details for NASA when designing and creating mission concepts.
