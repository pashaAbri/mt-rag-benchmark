If you mediate before filing a case and an agreement is reached at the mediation, there will be no need to file a small claims case. If a case has already been filed, the agreement reached at the mediation can be entered into the court record without having to appear in court. The Superior Court of California  provides free mediation services for litigants in small claims cases. The mediation is facilitated by trained volunteer mediators. The benefits of mediation include determining the outcome of the case by the parties themselves, saving important relationships without going to court, and having both views of the dispute heard. If the case is settled after the filing of the claim and before the hearing date, the plaintiff must file Judicial Council form \u201cRequest For Dismissal\u201d (CIV-110) with the court.",

        "text": "The Superior Court of California - County of Ventura - FAQs\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0When is Small Claims mediation appropriate?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0You can mediate your case before or after a small claims case has been filed. If you mediate before filing a case \r\n and an agreement is reached at the mediation, there will be no need to file a small claims case. If a case has already been filed, \r\n the agreement reached at the mediation can be entered into the court record without having to appear in court. You may also have \r\n an opportunity to mediate your case on the day of the hearing at the courthouse.\n\r\n Mediation may be particularly useful when parties have a relationship they want to preserve. So when family members, neighbors, \r\n or business partners have a dispute, mediation may be the most effective process to use. However, mediation may be beneficial in \r\n almost any kind of dispute between people. Mediation is effective even when emotions are getting in the way of resolution. An \r\n effective mediator can help the parties communicate with each other in a respectful and constructive manner.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0When may Small Claims mediation be inappropriate?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0Mediation may not be appropriate if one of the parties is unwilling to cooperate or communicate. Mediation also \r\n may not be effective if one of the parties has a significant advantage in power over the other. Therefore, mediation may not be \r\n a good choice if the parties have a history of abuse or victimization. Mediation is not appropriate in cases in which a crime is involved.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0What is the role of the Small Claims mediator?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0The mediator is an impartial neutral intermediary whose role is to facilitate a discussion of the issues and \r\n perspectives between the parties in an effort to help them reach an agreement. The mediator does not impose a settlement, \r\n but will assist the parties in exploring settlement options. Generally, the mediator does not communicate with the court except \r\n to file the parties\u00e2\u0080\u0099 settlement agreement.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0Is Small Claims mediation confidential?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0All communication, negotiations, or settlement discussions in the court of a mediation or mediation consultation \r\n are confidential. This means that whatever is said in the mediation meeting, even if no settlement is reached, may not be used \r\n in any later court proceeding.",

This means that whatever is said in the mediation meeting, even if no settlement is reached, may not be used \r\n in any later court proceeding.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0Is Small Claims mediation required by the court?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0Mediation is a \"voluntary\" process. Any party may end a mediation at any time without adverse consequences. \r\n The mediator is not empowered to hold you in a mediation against your wishes. That said, there is so much that is offered by mediation, \r\n and so little to lose, that you are encouraged to participate fully.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0How long does a Small Claims mediation last and how do I prepare?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0Usually, mediation of a small claims dispute lasts around 30 minutes to an hour if held at the court. \r\n You need to be prepared to discuss all relevant issues in your case. You need to be prepared to state your position and \r\n to listen carefully to the other side. You will be required to exchange evidence with the other side. This will be a \r\n requirement by the court even if you do not mediate in order to shorten trial time.\n\nQ:\u00a0\u00a0What if we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t settle our dispute at the Small claims mediation?\nA:\u00a0\u00a0If you and the other party are unable to reach a full agreement at the mediation, your case will still be \r\n decided by the Judge, Commissioner or Temporary Judge assigned to your small claims case usually on the same day your hearing \r\n was originally scheduled. If you mediate before filing a small claims case, but don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t reach a full agreement, you can still \r\n file a small claims case with the court.\n\r\n However, your claim may be time sensitive, so you may want to check with your attorney or with the Small Claims Advisor to \r\n determine when you have to file your case. You can visit the Small Claims Advisor in person or call (805) 654-5054.\n\nFor more information please visit our Small Claims page.",

    "original_text": "The Superior Court of California - County of Ventura offers a Small Claims Mediation Program, which provides free mediation services for litigants in small claims cases. The mediation is facilitated by trained volunteer mediators from the Ventura Center for Dispute Settlement. The benefits of mediation include determining the outcome of the case by the parties themselves, saving important relationships without going to court, and having both views of the dispute heard. If the case is settled after the filing of the claim and before the hearing date, the plaintiff must file Judicial Council form \u201cRequest For Dismissal\u201d (CIV-110) with the court."
