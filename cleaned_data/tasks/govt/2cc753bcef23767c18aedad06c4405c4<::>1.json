Who do I call about missed collection of garbage/recycling/organics service?\n\nA. Call Republic Services at their toll- free number, (800) 320-8077 before 12 noon for a return trip on the same day.\n\nQ. I need a replacement cart because mine is damaged or missing. Who do I call?\n\nA. Call Republic Services at their toll-free number, (800) 320-8077. Republic Services will also provide additional recyclables and organics carts at no extra cost.\n\nQ. Where should I place my carts for collection?\n\nA. Customers with on-premises (backyard) collection service should keep all their carts in an accessible location out of view from the street in the side or rear yard. The blue recycling cart should be kept next to the black and green carts and does not need to be taken to the curb.\n\nCustomers who have opted to have Curbside collection service should place all their carts within three feet of the curb for collection no earlier than 6:00 p.m. on the day prior to the scheduled collection day and must remove all carts from the curb no later than 12:00 midnight on the scheduled collection day. Customers may not place carts in a public street, or public sidewalk, but may place carts in the right-of-way parking strip. To help reduce scavenging, please place the carts out before 7:00 a.m.\n\nShould you need a trash enclosure to screen your bins please see the Trash Enclosure Information Brochure.\n\nQ. What should I do if I see someone other than the recycling company taking recyclables from my Blue Recycling Cart?\n\nA. Get a description of the person and/or the make and model of the vehicle and call the police non-emergency number, (510) 420-3000.\n\nGet Detailed Information on These Services:\nOrganics | Recycling | Garbage | Hazardous Waste | Bulky Items | E Waste \n| \nFAQ | Climate Action | Ordinances and Regulations \n| \nConstruction & Demolition Debris Recycling | Resources \n\nPiedmont Evergreen",
