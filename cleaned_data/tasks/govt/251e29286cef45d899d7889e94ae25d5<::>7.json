  "gold_answer": "Yes,\u00a0COVID-19 vaccines\u00a0have been thoroughly tested for safety and efficacy. They have undergone at least three phases of clinical trials. The vaccines have been proven to help protect against\u00a0COVID-19 and\u00a0reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Like any vaccine or medication,\u00a0the COVID-19 vaccines\u00a0can cause side effects, although most are mild and short-lived. Common side effects include\u00a0a sore arm where\u00a0the shot was given, headache, chills, fever, and Tiredness. These side effects usually go away on their own within a few days. Also,\u00a0people can have allergic reactions to any medication or biological product, such as a vaccine.",

Scientists have been studying the technology for mRNA vaccines for more than 20 years. And the National Institutes of Health (NIH) was working on creating a coronavirus vaccine even before the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThey got the funding they needed to work quickly.\u00a0The COVID-19 pandemic was a public health emergency. So the U.S. government invested millions of dollars to help study and test vaccines.\nThey used a faster review process with all the same steps.\u00a0The FDA authorized the original COVID-19 vaccines under their Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). An EUA follows the same steps that full-term clinical trials take. This includes testing each vaccine on thousands of human participants. The only difference is that an EUA speeds up the FDA\u2019s review process. This helps get critical vaccines to people faster while still making sure the vaccines are safe and that they work well.\nThey involved many experts in reviewing data.\u00a0Independent groups also reviewed trial results to make sure the vaccines are safe. These include groups like the National Medical Association, the leading professional society of Black doctors.\n\nThe FDA continues to monitor COVID-19 vaccines even after they\u2019re approved.\nPlay this FDA video to learn more about the EUA process (YouTube)\n\n It\u2019s safe to get several vaccines in the same year \n \n\nVaccines have pieces of germs or viruses, killed germs, or weakened germs in them.\nThe goal of a vaccine is to teach your immune system to make antibodies to fight off the real virus if you\u2019re exposed to it.

COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for people with underlying health problems like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, and obesity. People with these conditions are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19. Please consult with your health care provider if you have specific questions about the COVID vaccine and your health.\u00a0If I already had COVID-19 and recovered, do I still need to get vaccinated?\u00a0Yes. CDC recommends that you get vaccinated even if you have already had COVID-19, because you can catch it more than once. While you may have some short-term antibody protection after recovering from COVID-19, we don\u2019t know how long this protection will last.\u00a0Will the vaccine make me sick or will I have side effects?You may not notice any changes in how you feel after getting the shot. But it\u2019s also possible to feel a little \u201cunder the weather.\u201d This can happen after\u00a0any\u00a0vaccine. It is the body\u2019s immune response to getting vaccinated and a sign that the vaccine is starting to work.After the COVID-19 vaccine, you may have:A sore arm where you got the shotA headacheChillsFeverTirednessOver the counter pain relievers and fever reducers may help.You should feel better in a day or two. If you still don't feel well after two or three days, talk to your health care provider.Do COVID-19 vaccines work against variants\u00a0of the virus?\u00a0All COVID-19 vaccines authorized or approved for emergency use in the United States have proven extremely effective at preventing serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19. The effectiveness of the FDA-approved and -authorized vaccines remains strong even against newer strains, including against\u00a0variants.Those who are unvaccinated have the greatest risk of becoming seriously ill, which is why the New York State Department of Health urges all eligible New Yorkers to get vaccinated as soon as they are able.\u00a0Can I get an allergic reaction from the COVID-19 vaccine?People can have allergic reactions to any medication or biological product such as a vaccine.",
