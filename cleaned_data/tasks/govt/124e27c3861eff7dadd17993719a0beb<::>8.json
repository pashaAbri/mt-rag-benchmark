  "gold_answer": "If you are a whistleblower, you can protect yourself by using the Whistleblower Portal provided by the New York State Attorney General's Office. The portal allows anonymous submissions and two-way communications with the office through a unique key code that submitters can use to send and retrieve messages. To begin the anonymous submission process, you need to download and install Tor Browser on your computer, which provides an extra layer of security and privacy to protect your anonymity. After installation, launch Tor Browser and type the following URL into the Tor Browser's address bar: `http://wux56igrepfok5cz5eqszt3xr7ng6tqai2ayplbmvp5qxruax5eicjad.onion`. Once you have accessed the whistleblower portal, you can submit your communication via the simple form that asks for the subject of the communication, a description of the communication, and any supporting files available to upload. After submitting the form, you will receive a secret code to track your submission and communicate with the office anonymously.",

Whistleblowers are essential to fulfilling our mission: protecting the citizens of New York. Whistleblowing insiders are particularly critical in opaque industries, where transparency is limited.\nWe take special care to protect whistleblowers. While we encourage whistleblowers to identify themselves, we recognize that many whistleblowers have legitimate concerns about their anonymity because they report conduct by their employers, associates, or community members. The whistleblower portal allows anonymous submissions and two-way communications with our office through a unique key code that submitters can use to send and retrieve messages. As most people understand, the transmission of this information will be anonymous, but the content therein is not guaranteed to remain anonymous and confidential.\nTo begin the anonymous submission process, follow the instructions below:\n\n1. Download and install Tor Browser on your computer.\nOffice of the New York State Attorney General uses Tor Browser to provide an extra layer of security and privacy to protect the anonymity of whistleblowers.\u00a0 Individuals must download and install the Tor Browser on their computer first to connect and access the whistleblower portal.\u00a0\nTo learn more about Tor Browser and how it works, visit the official Tor Browser online documentation.\u00a0\n2.
