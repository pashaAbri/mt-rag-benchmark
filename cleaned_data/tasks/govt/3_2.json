  "gold_answer": "Yes, contaminated groundwater can be cleaned up, but it can be a time-consuming and expensive process. Communities whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the cost of providing the water to customers. It is far better to prevent contamination in the first place.",

      "text": "FAQs \u2022 Where do groundwater toxins come from?\nThe water is imported for us by the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a public agency, and of which the City of Monterey Park is a member.\t\n\n4.\nHow much water does the Monterey Park community use?\n\r\nUsage ranges from an average low of 7.3 million gallons per day (mgd) in February to an average high of 12 mgd in August. Average use per person is 100-110 gallons per day.\t\n\n5.\nWhat is ground water?\n\r\nContrary to what a lot of people think, groundwater is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments that lie beneath the surface of the earth, much the way water fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge or towel. \t\n\n6.\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\n\r\nThe San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater. Thus, keeping our groundwater resource clean is vitally important to all of us. \t\n\n7.\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze. These products are not only hazardous to our health, but to our environment. By disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\t\n\n8.\nCan contaminated groundwater be cleaned up?\n\r\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. Communities whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the cost of providing the water to customers.",

There are low levels of fluoride naturally occurring in the water. The range at which they occur is between 0.2 to 0.8 milligrams per liter (mg/L). The optimum fluoride level recommended to reduce dental caries (cavities) is a consistent .8 mg/L does. A bill signed by Governor Wilson in 1997 mandates drinking water fluoridation for larger water utilities, including Monterey Park, and requires the state to provide funding for the installation and operation of fluoridation equipment. The state is currently seeking funding for this program.\t\n\n10.\nDoes the City of Monterey Park own the Garvey Reservoir?\n\r\nThe Garvey Reservoir is not owned by the City of Monterey Park and the water it contains is not stored for city use.\t\n\nLive Edit\n\n \n\n \n\nCoronavirus Updates\n\nAgenda Center\n\nDocuments Prior to 2012\n\nTeleconference Procedures\n\nCity Council Meetings Written Communications / Addendums\n\nWritten Communications / Addendums 2024\n\nWritten Communications / Addendums 2023",
