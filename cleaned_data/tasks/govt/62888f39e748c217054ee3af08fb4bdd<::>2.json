There are more than 750,000 licensed motorcyclists and that number continues to grow with each passing year. For many people, motorcycling is a fun sport as well as an energy-efficient means of transportation. However, motorcycling can be dangerous. It requires skill, concentration and reasonable precautions.\nMotorcyclists are about 28 times more likely to die in a crash than people in passenger cars. Motorcyclists continue to be overrepresented in traffic-related fatalities; Despite representing only 3% of all registered motor vehicles, motorcyclists account for 14% of all traffic-related fatalities (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 2018).\n\nTaking Action\nEfforts to Improve Motorcycle Safety\n\nMotorcycle Safety Program\nThe Department of Motor Vehicles established a rider-funded motorcycle safety program as required by legislation signed in 1997. The program provides accessible and affordable rider education throughout NYS, in an effort\u00a0to create awareness and reduce motorcyclist injuries and fatalities.\n\nMotorcycle Helmet Law\nNew York was the first state in the nation to adopt a universal motorcycle helmet law. This law, effective as of January 1, 1967, requires any person operating or riding a motorcycle to wear a Department of Transportation (DOT)-approved helmet.\u00a0\n\nMotorcycle Safety Awareness Month",
