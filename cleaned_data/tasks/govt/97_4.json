  "gold_answer": "Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .",

As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno\u2019s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter\u2019s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere.\u00a0Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet.

As with solar eclipses on the Earth, within the dark circle racing across Jupiter's cloud tops one would witness a full solar eclipse as Io passes in front of the Sun. Such events occur frequently on Jupiter because it is a large planet with many moons. In addition, unlike most other planets in our solar system, Jupiter's axis is not highly tilted relative to its orbit, so the Sun never strays far from Jupiter's equatorial plane (+/- 3 degrees).",

And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms don\u2019t merge.\u00a0During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in.Scientists knew Jupiter had an intense magnetic field. Juno showed it\u2019s far more intense than anyone expected \u2013 in some places more than 30 times as powerful as the one surrounding Earth.\u00a0\u00a0The now-departed Galileo spacecraft dropped a probe into Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere in 1995 and found the place where it entered to be strangely dry, with one-tenth the water that scientists expected. Juno solved the mystery, showing that water is much more abundant nearer Jupiter\u2019s equator.\u00a0High-voltage electrical charges contribute to the formation of auroras at Jupiter\u2019s poles, just as they do on Earth. But Jupiter is the solar system\u2019s Texas: everything\u2019s bigger. The most powerful energies there come to 400,000 electron volts, while our most powerful auroras on Earth hit only a few thousand volts.\u00a0Maybe the most iconic storm in the solar system, Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot has been swirling for centuries. But it appears to be slowly shrinking, from twice Earth\u2019s size in 1979 to 1.3 times now. Juno plumbed the depths of this signature cyclone, showing that its roots run 200 miles (320 kilometers) deep \u2014 50 to 100 times as deep as Earth\u2019s oceans.\u00a0Since April 2022, Juno has been observing the volcano-covered moon Io. and has sent back images that appear to show fresh lava fields, in areas last seen in visible-light images during Galileo and New Horizon flybys (in 1999 and 2007).",
