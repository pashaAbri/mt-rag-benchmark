  "gold_answer": "If a parent posts personal information about their child on a state website, it may become a public record and may be subject to public inspection and copying, with some exceptions to protect the child's privacy. However, the State will not provide personal information about children to third parties. If the State decides to begin collecting personal information from children, it will notify parents, seek parental consent, and allow parents to request information on the type of data being collected, view their child\u2019s information, and prohibit further use of their child\u2019s information.",

For a child under 13 years old, when information and instructions are provided by the specific Web page that collects information about the child, personal information about your child will be destroyed immediately upon completion of its intended purpose.  Further, the CDC requires a child's parent or guardian to provide consent before they collect, use, or share personal information from a child under age 13. They also delete immediately any information about a child that they might inadvertently collect. Their digital media channels are not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under age 13.  So, both organizations have policies in place to protect children's privacy and require parental consent for collecting, using, or sharing personal information from a child under age 13.\n|user|: Raising protection to 18 yr old?\n|assistant|: Children are not eligible to use services that require submission of personal information, and we require that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information.

When a Caltech/JPL Web site needs to collect information about a child under 13 years old, COPPA required information and instructions will be provided by the specific Web page that collects information about the child. The Web page will specify exactly what the information will be used for, who will see it and how long it will be kept.There are several exceptions that permit collection of a child's personal information without receiving parental consent in advance:Collecting the child's name and parent's name and email address to provide the parents with notice and to seek consent for communications with the child.Collecting the child's email address in order to respond to a one time request from a child.Collecting the child's email address to respond more than once to a child's request; i.e., subscription to a newsletter, so long as the parent or guardian is notified after the first communication from the child to give the parent or guardian the opportunity to opt out of the information submitted by the child and cease communications from the Web site operator.Collecting the child's information in order to protect the safety of a child who is participating on the site; i.e., in a chat room. The operator needs to give notice to the parent.Collecting the child's information for the sole purpose of protecting the Web site, take precautions against liability or to respond to law enforcement; i.e., in the case of a Web site compromise.Personal information about a child under 13 years of age may be needed to respond to his/her communication to us, such as to receive a poster or to acquire information for a school project.
