      "text": "The 2022-23 Budget: The Governor\u2019s Homelessness Plan\nShifting State\u2011Local Relationship. Historically, local entities have provided most of the homelessness assistance in their jurisdiction, relying in part on federal and state funding. As the homelessness crisis has become more acute, the state has taken a larger role in funding and supporting local governments\u2019 efforts to address homelessness. The state has increased its role in addressing homelessness by\u00a0providing significant, albeit one\u2011time and temporary, funding towards infrastructure and flexible aid to local governments in recent years. \nUpdate on Key Recent Homelessness State Spending. Recent budget actions reflect the increased role of the state in addressing homelessness. The state budget provided a total of $7.2\u00a0billion ($3.3\u00a0billion General Fund) in 2021\u201122 to about 30 homelessness\u2011related programs across various state departments. We provide implementation updates for several of the major, recent homelessness augmentations. \nHomelessness Package Proposes to Focuses on Near\u2011Team Needs. The Governor\u2019s 2022\u201123 budget proposes $2\u00a0billion one\u2011time General Fund over two years that is intended to address near\u2011term homelessness needs while previously authorized funds for long\u2011term housing solutions are implemented: $1.5 billion for behavioral health \u201cbridge\u201d housing and $500 million for the Encampment Resolution Grants\u00a0Program. \nDevote Attention to Overseeing Recent Augmentations. We suggest the Legislature dedicate the early part of the budget process to overseeing the implementation of last year\u2019s significant homelessness augmentations. Prior to authorizing increased funding for the activities proposed in the 2022\u201123 budget, ensuring that the homelessness efforts authorized in prior budgets are operating effectively, adequately supported, and can be maintained over time will be important. \nConsider Long\u2011Term Plan for Ongoing Homelessness Efforts. Addressing this crisis requires a complex combination of services and infrastructure. As more information about recent state efforts becomes available, we suggest the Legislature assess which types of interventions appear most effective. This information could help guide the state\u2019s long\u2011term fiscal and policy role in addressing homelessness. \nFor Any Authorized Funds, Set Clear Expectations and Establish Metrics to Assess Performance. Setting clear expectations through statute and establishing reporting requirements to facilitate oversight over the state\u2019s progress towards addressing homelessness will be critical. \n\nBackground",
