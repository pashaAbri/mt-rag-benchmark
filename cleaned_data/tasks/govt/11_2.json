If you need help finding a lawyer, the California Bar Association website can connect you with a lawyer referral service in your area. When you meet with a lawyer, it's important to ask questions to understand the services they can provide and the associated costs. You should also ask about their experience in handling cases similar to yours. If you find their answers satisfactory and their fees reasonable, you may want to consider hiring them. However, make sure you fully understand the agreement before signing it. If you're uncomfortable with any terms, don't sign it. It may be best to seek a new lawyer if disagreements arise and cannot be resolved.",

Make sure you understand the agreement before you sign it. If you are not comfortable with any of the terms, do not sign it. And if you cannot work out your disagreement, you may want to find a new lawyer.\n\n Working with a lawyer for part of your case\n\n A lawyer can handle some parts of your case while you handle others. This is called limited-scope representation. Limited-scope representation can be a great way for you to have legal help with your case while keeping costs down.\n\n Understanding legal fees\n\n Make sure you are clear about how you will be billed.\u00a0Lawyers bill in different ways:\n\nFixed fee\nThe lawyer charges a set fee to do something, usually for routine legal matters\n\nHourly fee\nThe lawyer charges by the hour\n\nRetainer fee\nA \"down payment\" on any legal services. The legal fees will be subtracted from the retainer. If the retainer starts to run out, you may need to add more money.\n\nContingency fee\nYou pay the lawyer from the money you receive if you win the case or settle it out of court. If you lose, the lawyer does not receive a fee.\n\nStatutory fee\nThe cost is set by law\n\nThe lawyer will also charge you for the costs of your case (filing fees, copying expenses, expert fees). You will be responsible for paying these costs even if your case is not successful. Costs can add up quickly. It is a good idea to ask the lawyer for a written estimate of what the costs will be.\n\n Handling problems with a lawyer\n\n If you have questions or concerns about your case, first talk to your lawyer.\u00a0If you are having serious problems with your lawyer and have been unable to resolve them, there are other things you can do.\nThe State Bar also has a lot of information about what to do if you are having problems with your lawyer.\n\n \n\nWas this helpful?\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\ndid this information help you with your case?\n\nGreat!",

(Costs include telephone calls, photocopying, assistant help, court fees, travel expenses, and so on.)\nCan you put your estimates in writing?\nHow often will I be billed?\nCan I do some of the work?\n\nDeciding whether to hire the lawyer\nOnce you get answers to your questions, consider:\nWill you be comfortable working closely with the lawyer?\nDo you think the lawyer has the experience and skill to handle your case?\nDo you understand the lawyer's explanation of what your case involves?\nDoes the fee seem reasonable?\nIf the answers are yes, you may want to hire this lawyer.
