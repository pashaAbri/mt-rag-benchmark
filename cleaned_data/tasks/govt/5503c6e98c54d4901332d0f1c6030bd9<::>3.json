It produces oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere using a device called an \"electrolyzer,\" a close cousin to a fuel cell that is running in reverse. On Earth, trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through photosynthesis, but MOXIE uses a different process to achieve the same result.",

MOXIE will test a way for future explorers to produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere for burning fuel and breathing.\nTech Specs\n\nMain Job\nTo produce oxygen from the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere\n\nLocation\nInside the rover (front, right side)\n\nMass\nAbout 37.7 pounds (17.1 kilograms) on Earth\n\nWeight\n37.7 pounds on Earth, 14.14 pounds on Mars\n\nPower\n300 watts\n\nVolume\n9.4 x 9.4 x 12.2 inches\n(23.9 x 23.9 x 30.9 centimeters)\n\nOxygen Production Rate\nUp to 0.022 pounds per hour \n(up to 10 grams per hour)\n\nOperation Time\nApproximately one hour of oxygen (O2) production per experiment, scheduled intermittently over the duration of the mission.\n\n\"To support a human mission to Mars, we have to bring a lot of stuff from Earth, like computers, spacesuits, and habitats. But oxygen? If you can make it there, go for it \u2014 you're way ahead of the game.\" \n - Jeff Hoffman, MOXIE Deputy Principal Investigator\n\n5 Things to Know\n\nOxygen is Rare on Mars\nThere is less than 1% of air on Mars as there is on Earth, and carbon dioxide makes up about 96% of it on Mars. Oxygen is only 0.13%, compared to 21% in Earth's atmosphere. If we want oxygen on Mars, we either have to bring it along, or make it ourselves.\n\nFuel Needs Oxygen to Burn\nOn Earth, we are always getting energy from the reaction between oxygen and whatever fuel we are using \u2014 whether it's a log in a campfire or gasoline in a car tank. The oxygen weighs several times more than the fuel it burns, which is not an issue on our planet. However, when we have to bring it with us to other locations in space, we need to think a lot about that weight and other factors.\n\nMOXIE Makes Oxygen 'Out of Thin Air'",

In fact, there is less than 1% as much air on the surface of Mars as on Earth, and visiting Mars would be like flying in a balloon 100,00 feet up in the air. And not only is the air thin, but it's made almost entirely out of carbon dioxide (CO2).\nOn Earth, we can thank the myriad forms of life for the oxygen in our atmosphere that our body greedily absorbs with every breath we take. All around us, trees and plants are busy scrubbing CO2 out of our atmosphere and turning it into useful oxygen, at the same time taking up water and turning it into the chemicals that the plants need to live. Mars isn't so fortunate, so if we want oxygen on Mars we'll have to make it ourselves. That's what MOXIE does.\n\nWhat is ISRU?\n\nThe \"I\" in MOXIE stands for ISRU, or In Situ Resource Utilization. \"In Situ\" refers to the stuff that's there \u2013 on Mars in this case. Resource Utilization means using that stuff for some productive purpose, usually to make something that we would otherwise have to bring with us. In other words, living off the land (LOL). Maybe LOL would have been a better acronym than ISRU, but that's already been taken! One example of ISRU might be making bricks out of Martian soil, and using the bricks for buildings. Another example is making oxygen out of the thin Martian air.\n\nHow does MOXIE work?\n\nMOXIE is an example of a \"solid oxide electrolyzer cell,\" which is a fuel cell that runs in reverse. In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity.",

In a fuel cell, fuel and oxygen react to make energy (electricity) and a stable chemical product. The most common example is the hydrogen fuel cell, used in some automobiles, which combines hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity. A hydrogen cell of this type, in contrast, would start with the water and use electricity to turn it back into hydrogen and oxygen. The two devices, the fuel cell and the electrolyzer, are nearly identical devices, operated in a very different way.\nUsing water to make oxygen on Mars would be a great idea if we had easy access to the water. But to get water, we would have to travel to the far north or south to find ice, or to mine for ice buried deep in the ground. Fortunately, though, another source of oxygen is all around us, in the form of the carbon dioxide that makes up most of the Martian air. So instead of using hydrogen, MOXIE is an example of a solid oxide electrolyzer cell that uses carbon dioxide to make the gasses carbon monoxide and oxygen. \n\nWhy will we need oxygen on Mars?\n\nThe first human crew to go to Mars will need a lot of oxygen to breathe, as much as 2 to 3 tons. Our bodies use that oxygen to burn our fuel, which we call \"food,\" in order to make the energy that keeps us going all day. But it's not just humans who need oxygen. Nearly everything that uses fuel to make energy uses oxygen to burn that fuel, whether it's a car, a campfire, or a rocket. And it turns out that the oxygen, which on Earth we get for free from the air, actually weighs a lot more than the fuel itself.\nWhen we send the first crew to Mars, we would need to think about how to bring them home at the end of their visit. And the single biggest user of oxygen in their entire stay on Mars will be the rocket that takes them back to orbit.",

An electrolyzer is a close cousin to a fuel cell, which is a device we use to directly make electricity from fuel and oxygen. You can think of MOXIE as a fuel cell running in reverse. \n\nFor Scientists\nNASA is preparing for human exploration of Mars, and the MOXIE investigation on the Mars 2020 mission aims to address key knowledge gaps.\nRead More \u203a\n\nThe Story Behind the Name\nMOXIE stands for the Mars OXygen ISRU Experiment. ISRU is another acronym, In Situ Resource Utilization, which is a technical way of describing what most of us call \"living off the land.\"\nThe word \"moxie,\" used to describe someone with spunk and audacity, came from the soft drink of the same name. The soft drink, Moxie, was invented in the late 1800s in Lowell, Massachusetts, not far from the M.I.T. Haystack Observatory where the MOXIE principal investigator works. You can still buy Moxie in New England, and it's considered the official drink of the state of Maine.\nThe connection with soft drinks doesn't end there. According to some accounts, the Moxie company was the first in the U.S. to use carbon dioxide (CO2) to make a beverage fizzy. On Mars, MOXIE is the first to use carbon dioxide to make \u2013 well, anything at all. Another connection is more technical. Whenever we run MOXIE, we need to be very careful with the settings to make sure we only produce carbon monoxide (CO), and not pure carbon, which would ruin it. That destructive process is called \"coking.\" The carbon deposit itself is called \u2013 coke.\n\nAll About MOXIE\n\nWhat does MOXIE do?\n\nCompared to what we're used to on Earth, the air on Mars is very thin.
