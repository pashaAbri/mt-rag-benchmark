  "gold_answer": " NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core.  Furthermore, the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface.  Juno mission discoveries were so important  that is preparing the way for future visitors, such as ESA\u2019s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.",

As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025.

It crossed the orbit of Mars, but didn\u2019t continue onto Jupiter quite yet. Mission designers used the Sun\u2019s gravity and a pair of main engine burns in September 2012 to guide Juno back toward Earth \u2013 an essential detour.\u00a0\u00a0Juno returned home 26 months after it left. But it didn\u2019t stop.\u00a0\u00a0It dashed toward Earth, pulled in by gravity, then sped away with greater energy than before. In this maneuver, called a gravity assist, Juno borrowed some momentum from Earth \u2013 which itself is hurtling through space around the Sun at 18 miles per second (29 kilometers per second). This slingshot effect boosted Juno\u2019s velocity by 16,330 mph (about 7.3 kilometers per second), giving the spacecraft sufficient energy to climb away from the inner solar system and make it out to Jupiter.",

Underneath its dense cloud cover, Jupiter safeguards secrets to the fundamental processes and conditions that likely governed our solar system as it formed. Our primary example of a giant planet, Jupiter can also help us understand planetary systems being discovered around other stars.\u00a0\u00a0Theories about solar-system formation all begin with the collapse of a giant cloud of gas and dust, or nebula, the bulk of which went into forming the infant Sun. Like the Sun, Jupiter is mostly hydrogen and helium, so it must have formed early, capturing most of the material left over after our star came to be. How this happened, however, is unclear.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike Earth, Jupiter's giant mass allowed it to hold onto its original composition; like a time capsule, it provides us with a way to trace our solar system's history. Deciphering the origin and evolution of Jupiter will help us understand the formation of the rest of the solar system, including how Earth came to be, and how it became a haven for life.\u00a0Juno completed its primary mission by mid-2021, offering revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Now Juno has pivoted to an extended mission, in which NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter expands on the discoveries it already made, while also exploring the full Jovian system. That includes the dust in the planet\u2019s faint rings, and three of Jupiter\u2019s four Galilean Moons \u2013 Ganymede, Europa, and Io \u2013 so named because in 1610 Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei was the first to identify the quartet of satellites (Callisto is the fourth \u2013 farther out than the other three, and not visited by Juno).\u00a0seeing what galileo sawJupiter's MoonsIn January 1610, astronomer Galileo Galilei saw four points of light near Jupiter; but they didn't traverse the sky like other stars, they remained close to the planet.

Then, as part of its 57th and 58th orbits around the giant planet, Juno came within roughly 930 miles (1,500 kilometers) of Io's surface \u2013 less than the distance between Los Angeles and Seattle. The close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. Meanwhile, the gravitational pull Io exerted on Juno during the Feb. 3 flyby has reduced the spacecraft\u2019s orbit around Jupiter to 33 days.",
