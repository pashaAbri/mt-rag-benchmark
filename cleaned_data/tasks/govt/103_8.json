      "text": "Forces - NASA Science\nThey understand that there are four fundamental forces \u2014 gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces \u2014 that are responsible for shaping the universe we inhabit.Gravitational ForceNASAThe most familiar force is gravity. It is responsible for keeping our feet on the ground and holding Earth in its orbit around the Sun.According to the general theory of relativity, gravity can be understood as bends and curves in the fabric of space-time that affect the motions of galaxies, stars, planets, and even light. Anything with mass makes a dent in space-time, causing objects to be attracted to each other.Gravity is an attractive force that draws two objects together. Its strength approximately increases with the masses of the two objects but decreases with the square of the distance between them. That means that if the Moon were twice its current distance from Earth, the gravitational tug between the two would be just one fourth of what it is now.Despite being the weakest force, gravity works across infinite distances, making it responsible for the formation of the universe's structure.Electromagnetic ForceNASAOur television sets are powered by electromagnetism. Light carries this force, which illuminates our houses at night, keeps electrons in orbit around atomic nuclei, and allows chemical compounds to form.As the name implies, electromagnetism is the force that includes both electricity and magnetism. They are intertwined \u2014 a moving electric field produces a magnetic field, and vice versa.Like gravity, the strength of electromagnetism drops off with the square of the distance between objects and works at infinite range. However, electromagnetism only comes into play for charged objects, and whether it attracts or repels depends on the charges of each. Two negative or positive charges repel each other; one of each attracts.While electromagnetism is stronger than gravity, it is often balanced out in large objects by the equal numbers of positive and negative charges that form neutral atoms. For example, Earth has a magnetic field due to electric currents in its liquid core; however, Earth itself is electrically neutral.Strong Nuclear ForceNASANuclear forces affect our daily lives, but they work on distances smaller than atoms.The strong nuclear force, or strong force for short, holds together the building blocks of atoms. It always attracts and works at two different size scales in atoms.",
