    "text": "Being prepared to take care of yourself during a disaster is crucial. This means having enough food, water, and other supplies to last at least three days if stores are closed and roads are impassable due to a flood or winter storm. While local officials and relief workers will be available after a disaster, they may only be able to reach some people after a disaster. You could receive help within hours, but it may take days. It's important to note that the recommendation to have at least three days' worth of disaster supplies differs from the advice to shelter in place, which may involve using duct tape and plastic sheeting during an emergency. The Red Cross advises people to have these supplies on hand if needed.",

The Red Cross recommends that people have these supplies on hand in case they are needed.You would seal only one room when advised to do so, and do it only when instructed - not in advance. It is likely that one roll of duct tape will be adequate. Plastic sheeting of durable thickness (thicker than food wrap) is recommended for covering vents and other openings to the outside - not the entire room. It is intended to provide a barrier to air flow. While we can not guarantee that plastic sheeting over air vents will stop all biological, chemical, or radiological agents, it will add to the barrier of protection for your safety.\t\n\n5.\nDo I need a safe room? What is a safe room?\n\r\nA safe room, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is a room - preferably below ground - in which people can take shelter from a tornado. If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat.",
