While we can not guarantee that plastic sheeting over air vents will stop all biological, chemical, or radiological agents, it will add to the barrier of protection for your safety.\t\n\n5.\nDo I need a safe room? What is a safe room?\n\r\nA safe room, as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), is a room - preferably below ground - in which people can take shelter from a tornado. If such a room is below ground, it may not be the safest choice if told to stay at home and shelter-in-place during a weapons of mass destruction event due to the possibility that some contaminants may seep into rooms below ground level. For this reason, the Red Cross recommends and endorses having a safe room in areas where tornadoes are a threat. However, do not confuse a safe room used for protection from windstorms with a room selected for shelter-in-place. They are technically different, although they serve a similar purpose. If a safe room for windstorms is above ground level and has no windows, it can also be an ideal location in which to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n6.\nHow much time do I have to get to my designated room to shelter-in-place once I hear of an attack?\n\r\nThe situation will vary, depending on the nature of the event. It is best to take immediate protective action as soon as you think there is a local emergency, or if you hear on the radio or television that you need to shelter-in-place.\t\n\n7.\nDo I need to put towels under my door? Should they be wet?\n\r\nWet towels under a door are used in cases when you are in a room from which you can not escape and a fire is on the other side. That is not the same thing as what needs to be done when you shelter-in-place. See the instructions on shelter-in-place on the Red Cross website.\t\n\n8.\nIf I seal off my rooms and vents, how will I breathe? How long should I anticipate being in the room in which I am sheltering-in-place?",

However, if the safe room is located below ground, it may not be suitable for protection during a weapons of mass destruction event. The Red Cross recommends safe rooms for areas prone to tornadoes. It's important not to confuse safe rooms for tornadoes with shelter-in-place rooms. An above-ground safe room with no windows can also be used as a shelter-in-place location. It's important to note that a safe room used for protection from windstorms is different from a room selected for shelter-in-place, although they serve a similar purpose. If an above-ground safe room for windstorms has no windows, it can also be an ideal location for sheltering-in-place.\n|user|: What items should I keep?\n|assistant|: Being prepared to take care of yourself during a disaster is crucial. This means having enough food, water, and other supplies to last at least three days if stores are closed and roads are impassable due to a flood or winter storm. While local officials and relief workers will be available after a disaster, they may only be able to reach some people after a disaster. You could receive help within hours, but it may take days. It's important to note that the recommendation to have at least three days' worth of disaster supplies differs from the advice to shelter in place, which may involve using duct tape and plastic sheeting during an emergency. The Red Cross advises people to have these supplies on hand if needed.\n|user|: Is it the same for earthquakes?\n|assistant|: Each disaster has its characteristics, but it's important to plan and prepare today for you and your family to recover from an emergency tomorrow. Here are some steps you can take: 1. Get an Emergency Supplies kit lasting up to three days per family member, and remember supplies for your pets. 2. Make a family communication plan, including shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures. 3. Stay informed by visiting Ready.gov and signing up for emergency notifications from San Mateo County (SMC) Alert. 4. Get involved by signing up for a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) course and learning life-saving techniques in a CPR class. Remember, earthquakes can happen suddenly and without warning. Identifying potential hazards and planning can reduce the risk of severe injury or loss of life during an earthquake. If your home is damaged, check for gas leaks and avoid using toilets if you suspect sewage lines are damaged. Contact the gas company and a plumber if needed. In the same way, if water pipes are damaged, please contact the water company and avoid using tap water. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes. Each county prone to earthquakes has guides to help citizens before, during, and after an earthquake. Please reach out to your city hall for more information.\n|user|: Which state has more wildfires?\n|assistant|: The documents do not specifically mention California, but it is known that the 2018 wildfire season was the deadliest and most destructive on record in the state. The 2020 California wildfire season saw record-setting wildfires burn across the state, with nearly 10,000 fires burning over 4.2 million acres by the end of the year. This accounted for more than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season in California's modern history. The August Complex fire, part of the 2020 wildfire year, has been described as the first \"gigafire\" due to the area burned exceeding 1 million acres. This fire spread across seven counties and was larger than the state of Rhode Island.\n|user|: What causes wildfires?\n|assistant|: Although wildfires occur naturally from lightning, human activities cause most wildfires. Drought fuels wildfires, as happened in the Amazon, caused by the El Ni\u00f1o system.\n|user|: Why doesn't the government prevent people from living in areas prone to flooding?"
