Through thoughtful, forward-thinking, and data-driven selection of grants to local and state agencies, the OTS strives to reach our goal where everyone will go safely on California roads. Through grant funding made available to California by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the OTS funds more than $100 million dollars annually in innovative, evidence-based education and enforcement programs and technologies designed to improve road safety. The OTS evaluates all potential programs to make sure California addresses current and future traffic safety needs. Our success depends on strong partnerships. We work with approximately 300 state and local agencies to make the most effective use of federal grant program funds. Additionally, we coordinate with traffic safety partners to track successful programs, encourage collaboration, develop new countermeasures, and explore emerging trends. In addition to the many programs funded through these grants, the OTS team is committed to sharing the message of traffic safety.

Recognizing the need to reduce the carnage on the nation\u2019s roads, Congress passed the National Highway Safety Act, which provides for federal traffic safety funds to states.\nIn 1967, the California Traffic Safety Program (TSP) was enacted by the Legislature to provide authority for the State to implement the requirements of the national legislation. Subsequently, the Governor delegated authority to administer the TSP to the Secretary of the Business, Transportation and Housing (BT&H) Agency. In turn, the Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) was created in the BT&H Agency to administer the TSP under the direction of the Governor\u2019s Highway Safety Representative.\nSince that time, the work and influence of OTS has grown and spread. In the early days, funding, expertise, and results were scarce. Over the years, OTS staff became skilled professionals, programs expanded, and local authorities embraced the traffic safety message. Interest grew, priorities areas were established, and traffic deaths and injuries began to fall.\nEach year a Highway Safety Plan (HSP) is developed to reflect current needs as well as detailing the planned use of federal funds. The HSP identifies problems, specific performance measures, proposed solutions, time frames and fiscal information on continuing and planned new grants which are designed to mitigate traffic safety problems. OTS\u2019 role in this cycle has proven invaluable as it provides a vital link among Federal, State and local functions.\nOTS became the national leader in innovative programs to save lives on its roadways. It has established results driven best-practices and encouraged new strategies. While the state\u2019s population continues to grow, traffic deaths and injuries are falling.\n\nLegislative Bill Establishing the Office of Traffic Safety\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\nBack to Top\n\nContact OTS\n\nConditions of Use\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSite Map\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nX\n\nYouTube\n\nCopyright \u00a9 State of California\nPowered by: CAWeb Publishing Service",
