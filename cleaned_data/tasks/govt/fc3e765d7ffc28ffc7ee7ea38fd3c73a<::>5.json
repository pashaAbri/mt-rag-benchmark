Counties can use some of these funds to support the necessary case management activities for youth receiving Foster Youth to Independence (FYI) or Family Unification Program (FUP) vouchers. The FYI/FUP vouchers offer a 36-month rental subsidy through the housing authority and supportive services provided or arranged by the county child welfare agency. Section 8 of the Housing Choice Voucher Program is also available for very low-income families, older people, and people with disabilities. These vouchers allow recipients to find their housing as long as it meets the program's requirements.",

FYI/FUP vouchers provide a 36\u2011month rental subsidy (through the voucher provided by the housing authority), paired with supportive services provided or secured through the county child welfare agency.\n\nStatus: Housing Navigators funded as part of 2019\u201120 budget and expanded to become HNMP in 2022\u201123.\n\nGeneral Fund allocations: $13.7 million annually\n\nCounties: 51 counties have been allocated funding in 2023.\n\nExpenditures: Unknown. Grantees have multiple years to expend funding.\n\nTotal youth served in 2023: Unknown how many total youth are served by HNMP. Stakeholders estimate more than 1,300 youth were recipients of federal housing funding through FYI and FUP voucher programs as of November 2023.\n\nOverview of Administration\u2019s Proposal for Permanent CCR Rates Structure\nBackground on CCR Rates. As part of implementing CCR, the state developed a new foster care maintenance payment rates structure to replace the previous age-based and group home rates structure. Under CCR, foster care rates must be based on the assessed level of need of individual youth (\u201clevel of care\u201d), with youth requiring higher levels of behavioral health supports and other more therapeutic and intensive services receiving higher rates. Since 2017, the state has been implementing interim level of care (LOC) rates for resource families, Short-Term Residential Therapeutic Programs (STRTPs), Foster Family Agencies (FFAs), Intensive Services Foster Care (ISFC), and other specialized models of foster care. Statute specifies that the interim rates will expire December 31, 2024 and that the permanent, ongoing LOC rates structure will be established by January 1, 2025. In working toward meeting this statutory requirement, alongside the 2024-25 Governor\u2019s budget, DSS has shared an initial concept paper outlining a new proposed framework for the permanent rates structure.\nCurrent Rates Structure Relies on Level of Care Protocol (LOCP).",

    "original_text": "\nIn California, some housing programs are available for individuals receiving welfare. The California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) administers various rental housing and homeownership programs to assist low-income households. One such program is the California Housing Finance Agency (CalHFA), which offers several loan products to help first-time homebuyers with low to moderate incomes. Additionally, the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program, funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), helps eligible low-income families, the elderly, and persons with disabilities afford safe and sanitary housing. Participants typically pay around 30% of their income for rent, and the voucher covers the rest. However, waiting lists for these programs can be long due to high demand."
