    "text": "Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.",

One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes.

As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno\u2019s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter\u2019s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere.\u00a0Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet.

The small red arrows show warm, moist air rising from the ocean's surface, and forming clouds in bands around the eye. The blue arrows show how cool, dry air sinks in the eye and between the bands of clouds. The large red arrows show the rotation of the rising bands of clouds.\nWhen the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane.\nTropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely.\nTropical cyclone categories:\n\nCategory\nWind Speed (mph)\nDamage at Landfall\nStorm Surge (feet)\n\n1\n74-95\nMinimal\n4-5\n\n2\n96-110\nModerate\n6-8\n\n3\n111-129\nExtensive\n9-12\n\n4\n130-156\nExtreme\n13-18\n\n5\n157 or higher\nCatastrophic\n19+\n\nThe two GOES satellites keep their eyes on hurricanes from far above Earth's surface\u201422,300 miles above, to be exact!

Image made from GOES satellite data.\n\nHurricanes are the most violent storms on Earth. People call these storms by other names, such as typhoons or cyclones, depending on where they occur. The scientific term for all these storms is tropical cyclone. Only tropical cyclones that form over the Atlantic Ocean or eastern Pacific Ocean are called \"hurricanes.\"\nWhatever they are called, tropical cyclones all form the same way.\n\nTropical cyclones are like giant engines that use warm, moist air as fuel. That is why they form only over warm ocean waters near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward from near the surface. Because this air moves up and away from the surface, there is less air left near the surface. Another way to say the same thing is that the warm air rises, causing an area of lower air pressure below.\n\nA cumulonimbus cloud. A tropical cyclone has so many of these, they form huge, circular bands.\n\nAir from surrounding areas with higher air pressure pushes in to the low pressure area. Then that \"new\" air becomes warm and moist and rises, too. As the warm air continues to rise, the surrounding air swirls in to take its place. As the warmed, moist air rises and cools off, the water in the air forms clouds. The whole system of clouds and wind spins and grows, fed by the ocean's heat and water evaporating from the surface. \nStorms that form north of the equator spin counterclockwise. Storms south of the equator spin clockwise. This difference is because of Earth's rotation on its axis.\nAs the storm system rotates faster and faster, an eye forms in the center. It is very calm and clear in the eye, with very low air pressure. Higher pressure air from above flows down into the eye.",

    "original_text": "Cyclones on Earth, also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location, are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear. However, the specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface."
