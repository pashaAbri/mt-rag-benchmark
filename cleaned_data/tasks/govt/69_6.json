You will use mirrors to move the laser and avoid obstacles to get the data back to Earth. Each level has new challenges and your ultimate goal is to build a communication network and synchronize, or match, the time on atomic clocks.\n\nAbout the mission\nOptical communication uses lasers to send data with a type of light that we can\u2019t see, called infrared light. Since the 1950s, NASA missions have used a different type of waves, called radio waves, to send data to and from space. With current radio wave communications, it takes about nine weeks to send a complete map of Mars back to Earth. With lasers, it only takes about nine days!\nOptical communication is very useful for space missions because data can be sent faster and more securely. Optical communication systems are also smaller, weigh less, and use less power. A smaller size means more room for science instruments, and using less power means less of a drain of the spacecraft\u2019s batteries. These are all very important details for NASA when designing and creating mission concepts.

Get to know the missions In this game, you\u2019ll lead a mission to explore some of the most interesting environments in our solar system including the Moon, Mars, and Jupiter's moon Europa. Before getting started, read on to learn about some of the current and future NASA missions exploring the same destinations you will soon encounter with your fleet of spacecraft. NASA\u2019s Artemis program calls for sending the first woman and next man to the surface of the Moon by 2024. It also seeks to establish a permanent and sustainable presence on the Moon. The agency will use what we learn on the Moon to prepare for humanity's next giant leap \u2013 sending astronauts to Mars.On Mars, Perseverance, NASA's most advanced Mars rover to date, is taking the next steps in our exploration of the Red Planet. Only the fifth NASA rover to land on Mars, Perseverance is building on the work and scientific discoveries of its predecessors by searching for evidence of ancient microbial life on the Red Planet.In the near future, NASA plans to take its search for life even farther into the solar system to Jupiter's ocean moon Europa. This small moon contains more water beneath its icy shell than all of Earth's oceans combined. NASA's Europa Clipper mission, currently in development, is designed to orbit Europa, make up-close observations, and investigate whether the icy moon has conditions suitable for life.About the image: From left to right: An artistic depiction of the Artemis program's Gateway space station; a selfie taken by the Perseverance rover on Mars; and an artistic depiction of the Europa Clipper spacecraft orbiting Jupiter's moon Europa.
