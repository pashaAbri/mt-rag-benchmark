Neon pink and neon orange offer the most visibility for light-bottomed pools. For lakes and dark-bottomed pools, neon green, neon orange and neon yellow are the most visible.\nConsider learning CPR. In an emergency, every second counts.\n\nBe aware of the conditions. \r\n\t\nOcean swimming is very different from pool swimming, so be prepared for powerful waves, strong surf and sudden drop-offs. \nRip currents usually form near a shallow point in the water, and can happen at any beach with breaking waves, including the Great Lakes. If you are caught in a rip current, try to remain calm and\r\n\tdon't fight it. Swim parallel to the shore until you are out of the current, and float or tread water if you begin to tire. More from the National Weather Service: Break the Grip of the Rip! \nKeep away from the water's edge. Jagged, slippery rocks and murky waters can be hazardous.\n\nBe aware of the rules.\r\n\t\nSwim only in designated areas, and only when a lifeguard is on duty. Prohibited swim areas are often accompanied by dangers such as turbulent underwater currents, extreme cold, and widely varying depths. \r\n\tThese hazards can put even good swimmers at risk.\nChoose a swimming spot near a lifeguard for maximum visibility. Always follow their directions, and ensure that any children you are swimming with do the same.\nWatch for warning flags and know what they mean. Green flags usually mark designated swimming areas - be sure to swim between the green flags. Yellow flags may denote a surfing beach or an advisory. \r\n\tRed flags indicate a danger or hazard. Flag designations may vary, so be sure to understand the color coding before you dive in.\n\nBe attentive.\r\n\t\nAlways swim sober.\nIf you're swimming with children, designate a \"water watcher\" who will always keep a close eye on the kids.
