Pile conditions within that range will promote rapid decomposition and destroy pathogens and weed seeds. Above that temperature range, beneficial microorganisms cannot survive. Below that range, decomposition will occur more slowly, and pathogens and weed seeds may remain in the final compost. Pile temperatures must remain at 131 degrees Fahrenheit or above for several days to meet standards for reducing pathogens. The exact amount of time depends on the method of composting. Controlling the oxygen, moisture, pile structure, and nutrient balance helps achieve the optimal temperature range in a compost pile.\nModels of Composting\nComposting can take place at a range of scales and locations. Site and facility management can be public, private, or a combination. Materials arrive at composting sites through different collection programs.\nThe fundamentals of composting are the same no matter the size or scale of an operation. However, the volume of materials composted, the types of feedstock, and the composting methods and equipment used may differ. Composting operations that handle large volumes of materials and certain feedstocks - such as biosolids or manures - may have additional permitting or zoning requirements, depending on state and local regulations.\n\nBackyard/Home Composting\nBackyard/home composting occurs in residential settings \u2013 often in a backyard pile or a small, enclosed bin. Vermicomposting, or worm composting, is also an option for home composters. Home composting systems mostly handle food scraps (except for meat, bones, and dairy products) and yard trimmings. By composting at home, households reduce their trash going to the landfill or incinerator and use the compost they produce in their garden, yard, or house plants.

Windrows can be turned periodically or have perforated pipes underneath them to allow air flow. Small to large volumes and a wide variety of materials can be composted using this method, which makes it adaptable to many scales and sites for composting. Windrow composting often requires equipment such as front-end loaders, excavators, or windrow turners.\nIn-Vessel\nIn-vessel composting can process a variety of organic materials without taking up much space. This method involves feeding materials into a vessel, such as a drum, silo, concrete-lined trench, or similar enclosed equipment. The materials are then mechanically turned or mixed in the vessel with bulking agents like wood chips to ensure aeration. Vessels, also known as bioreactors, vary in size and capacity. A similar composting method that takes place in an enclosed area is an agitated bay system where mixing and aerating equipment moves compost along walled bays or beds as it decomposes and stabilizes.\nWorm Composting (Vermicomposting)\n\n Resources\n \n\nCheck out EPA\u2019s Home Composting page as well as vermicomposting resources from North Carolina State University Cooperative Extension.\n\nWorm composting, or vermicomposting, relies on earthworms and microorganisms to break down organic materials into vermicompost, or worm castings, a high-quality soil amendment. A vermicomposting system can be indoors or outdoors in the shade and sized to match the volume of food scraps put into the system. Vermicomposting can used by households, schools, farms, institutions, and businesses. A properly maintained vermicomposting system does not produce odors or attract pests.\nIt is essential to use a suitable worm species, such as red wrigglers (Eisenia fetida). Worms are kept in a closed bin or system that should be shielded from light and rain, with sufficient air flow, and a way to drain excess liquid. The ideal temperature for a vermicomposting system is 55 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit.",
