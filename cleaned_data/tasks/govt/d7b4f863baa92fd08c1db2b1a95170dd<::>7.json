        "text": "NASA Astrophysics - NASA Science\nBlack holes are now known to be present at the center of most galaxies, including the Milky Way galaxy. The age, size and shape of the universe have been mapped based on the primordial radiation left by the big bang. And it has been learned that most of the matter in the universe is dark and invisible, and the universe is not only expanding, but accelerating in an unexpected way.For the long term future, the Astrophysics goals will be guided based on the results of the 2020 Decadal survey Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s. It identifies the most compelling science goals and presents an ambitious program of ground- and space-based activities for future investment. The report recommends critical near-term actions to support the foundations of the profession as well as the technologies and tools needed to carry out the science.In 2012 the Astrophysics Implementation Plan was released which describes the activities currently being undertaken in response to the decadal survey recommendations within the current budgetary constraints. The plan was updated in 2014, 2016, and in 2018.The Astrophysics roadmap Enduring Quests, Daring Visions was developed by a task force of the Astrophysics Subcommittee (APS) in 2013.",

        "text": "Galaxies - NASA Science\nMost large galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, some with billions of times the Sun\u2019s mass.Galaxies come in a variety of shapes, mostly spirals and ellipticals, as well as those with less orderly appearances, usually dubbed irregular.Most galaxies are between 10 billion and 13.6 billion years old. Some are almost as old as the universe itself, which formed around 13.8 billion years ago. Astronomers think the youngest known galaxy formed approximately 500 million years ago.Galaxies can organize into groups of about 100 or fewer members held together by their mutual gravity. Larger structures, called clusters, may contain thousands of galaxies. Groups and clusters can be arranged in superclusters, which are not gravitationally bound. Superclusters, empty voids, \u201cwalls\u201d of galaxies, and other large-scale structures make up the cosmic web of matter in the universe.Our Milky WayOur home galaxy is called the Milky Way. It\u2019s a spiral galaxy with a disk of stars spanning more than 100,000 light-years. Earth is located along one of the galaxy\u2019s spiral arms, about halfway from the center. Our solar system takes about 240 million years to orbit the Milky Way just once.This illustration shows the Milky Way, our home galaxy.NASA/JPL-CaltechFrom our perspective on Earth, the Milky Way looks like a faint, milky band of light arcing across the entire sky, which is how it got its name. This feature marks the central disk of our home galaxy seen edge on.The Milky Way sits in a neighborhood with over 50 other galaxies called the Local Group.",
