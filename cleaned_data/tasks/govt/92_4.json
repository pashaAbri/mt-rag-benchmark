The result is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier environment. To learn more, visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website.\n\nQ. How do I recycle food scraps?\n\nA. Collect food scraps and food-soiled paper in the green kitchen pail. Empty the pail contents into the large green Organics cart for collection. DO NOT place the kitchen pail outside for collection. Refer to the service guide at the top of this page for additional information and hints on Food Scrap Recycling. You can also visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website to learn more.\n\nQ. If I put my food scraps down the garbage disposal, do they get composted?\n\nA. No. These food scraps from household garbage disposals end up in the wastewater system and do not get composted. However, the East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD) wastewater treatment plant at the base of the Bay Bridge in Oakland not only treats sewage but takes food scraps from restaurants and supermarkets that usually go to the landfill and converts them into renewable energy. The process is a natural microbial activity called anaerobic digestion which converts these food scraps into biogas, which is used to power EBMUD's wastewater plant. The excess energy is sold back to the grid or used as carbon credits. The project supports local and regional efforts towards green- house gas reduction (climate change), oil independence, zero waste and landfill reduction.\n\nQ. I'm interested in home composting. Where can I get more information?\n\nA. Home composting information can be found on the StopWaste.org website.\n\nI am interested in Recycling the Right Way\n\nQ. Is recycling free?\n\nA. Recycling is a weekly, unlimited service and included at no extra cost.\n\nQ. What goes in the Blue Recycling Cart?",

I just completed a yard clean-up. How do I dispose of all the yard debris that does not fit in my Green Organics Cart?\n\nA. On those periodic occasions when a single-family customer has additional green waste more than what can be placed in the Green Organics Cart, they may call Republic Services at (800) 320-8077 to request overage bags in which to place the additional plant debris. Organics collection is unlimited in volume and is provided at no additional cost. If a customer regularly finds that they have more yard debris than will fit in the green Organics cart, they can call Republic Services to request an additional green cart.\n\nQ. Why should I recycle food scraps?\n\nA. Properly sorting your food scraps and food soiled paper not only helps fight climate change, it's now the law. Effective January 2022, State law (SB 1383) requires all residents and businesses to keep compostable and recyclable materials of of California's landfills and subscribe to organics collective services. Food scraps and food soiled paper are the largest single item in our waste stream - making up approximately 35% of what we throw away in Alameda County. Food scraps are a resource, not a waste. By participating in the food scrap recycling program, food scraps and food soiled paper are sent to a composting facility. Instead of taking up space in the landfill, your food scraps become compost - a valuable resource used by landscapers and farmers. The result is a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a healthier environment. To learn more, visit the http://stopfoodwaste.org website.\n\nQ. How do I recycle food scraps?\n\nA.
