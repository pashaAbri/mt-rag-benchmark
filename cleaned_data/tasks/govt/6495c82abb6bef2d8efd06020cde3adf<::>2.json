    "text": "Yes, that is true.The rate of sea level rise is faster now than at any time in the past 2,000 years, and that rate has doubled in the past two decades.  Accordingly to studies from 2022, that is tracking 30 years of sea level rise global has risen 101 millimeters (3.98 inches) since 1992, and it continues to do so at 3.9 mm (0.15 inches) per year. The globe is warming, ice is melting, factors that help the sea level to rise. In addition, global sea level can fluctuate due to climate patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, which influence ocean temperature and global precipitation patterns. NASA has also been conducting airborne and ship-based campaigns such as Operation IceBridge and Oceans Melting Greenland to gather measurements of ice sheets and glaciers. Although rise of a few inches over a few decades does not sound like much. But sea level does not rise evenly; it piles up more in some places because of natural wind and current patterns. And turbulence matters.",

It helps scientists track Earth's rising seas and enables more accurate weather, ocean and climate forecasts.\n\nKeep scrolling. There's one more NASA satellite out there!\n\nDid you know other planets have atmospheres, too? In fact, Mercury is the only planet in our solar system without an atmosphere!\n\nThere are so few gas particles in the exosphere that they almost never bump into each other.\n\nSuomi-NPP Satellite\nThe Suomi-NPP satellite orbits Earth approximately 14 times per day collecting information about long-term climate change and short-term weather conditions.\n\nA-Train satellite constellation\nNASA's A-Train satellite constellation orbits Earth like a train on a \"track\" 438 miles (705 kilometers) above Earth's surface. Each satellite orbits only minutes or seconds behind the satellite in front of it. The satellites and their scientific instruments work together to examine aspects of land, water and air on Earth.\n\nExosphere\nThe exosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's atmosphere, which separates the atmosphere from outer space.\n\nDid you ever wonder what atmospheric pressure is? Each layer of our atmosphere weighs down on the layer below it. If you're on a mountaintop or in an airplane, you experience lower atmospheric pressure than if you're at sea level.\n\nThe ionosphere is a very active part of the atmosphere. It grows and shrinks depending on the energy it absorbs from the Sun.\n\nDid you know that only a small part of Earth's atmosphere is breathable air? If Earth were the size of a beach ball, the breathable atmosphere wrapped around it would be as thin as paper.\n\nInternational Space Station (ISS)\nThe International Space Station, which hosts an international crew of 6 astronauts, orbits Earth about 16 times a day, or once every 90 minutes. It also is home to science instruments that collect information about Earth and its atmosphere.\n\nDid you ever wonder why the atmosphere doesn't float off into space?",

But sea level does not rise evenly; it piles up more in some places because of natural wind and current patterns. And turbulence matters. Imagine a bathtub with a child sloshing around in it. Waves can roll up one side and then the other, sometimes splashing over the brim. The higher the flat-water line (sea level), the greater the chance that the water will slosh out of the basin when it is stirred up by storms and winds.\nSea level also matters in a horizontal direction. A rule of thumb is that 1 inch of vertical change in sea level translates into 100 inches of horizontal loss on a flat beach or marsh. In this way, a little bit of sea level rise can translate into a lot of water moving inland when there are storms or abnormally high tides. \u201cSea level is important because it gradually moves the high-tide line farther up the beach and closer to buildable land,\u201d said John Jaeger, a coastal geologist from the University of Florida. \u201cIt also allows storm surges to penetrate farther inland.\u201d\n\nJanuary 28, 2015JPEG\n\nThe high-tide line has been moving landward for some time at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. NASA\u2019s most famous center covers more than 66 square miles (170 square kilometers) and holds about 20 percent of the agency\u2019s constructed assets. Most of KSC is built on coastal marshland that stands about 5 to 10 feet above sea level. Conservative climate models project that the seas off Kennedy will rise 5 to 8 inches by the 2050s, and 9 to 15 inches by the 2080s. If the ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica continue to melt as quickly as current measurements indicate, those numbers could become 21 to 24 inches by the 2050s and 43 to 49 inches by the 2080s.\n\u201cWe consider sea-level rise and climate change to be urgent,\u201d said Nancy Bray, spaceport integration and services director for Kennedy.",

        "text": "Sea Level Rise is Accelerating\n\u201cThe TOPEX/Poseidon/Jason altimetry missions have been essentially providing the equivalent of a global network of nearly half a million accurate tide gauges, providing sea surface height information every 10 days for over 25 years,\u201d said Brian Beckley of NASA Goddard. \u201cAs this climate data record approaches three decades, the fingerprints of Greenland and Antarctic land-based ice loss are now being revealed in the global and regional mean sea level estimates.\u201d\nEven with a 25-year data record, it can be challenging to detect acceleration. Episodes like volcanic eruptions can create variability; for instance, the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 decreased global mean sea level just before the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite launch. In addition, global sea level can fluctuate due to climate patterns such as El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, which influence ocean temperature and global precipitation patterns.\nNerem and the research team used climate models and other data sets to account for the volcanic effects and to determine the El Ni\u00f1o /La Ni\u00f1a effects, ultimately uncovering the underlying rate and acceleration of sea level rise. They also compared their results to tide gauges on Earth\u2019s surface. \u201cTide gauge measurements are essential for determining the uncertainty in the global mean sea level acceleration estimate,\u201d said co-author Gary Mitchum of the University of South Florida. \u201cThey provide the only assessments of the satellite instruments from the ground.\u201d\n\nIn addition to making direct sea level observations from space, NASA has been conducting airborne and ship-based campaigns such as Operation IceBridge and Oceans Melting Greenland to gather measurements of ice sheets and glaciers. In 2018, NASA will launch two new satellite missions that will be critical to improving future sea level projections: the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission, a partnership with GeoForschungsZentrum (Germany) and Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). \nNASA Scientific Visualization Studio images by Kel Elkins, using data from JASON-1, JASON-2, and TOPEX/Poseidon.

This satellite measures sea level, wind speed, and wave height for more than 95% of Earth's ice-free ocean, helping scientists track Earth's rising seas and enabling more accurate weather, ocean, and climate forecasts."
