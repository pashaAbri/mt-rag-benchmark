Be sure to follow these safety guidelines when viewing a solar eclipse.Quick FactsThe next total solar eclipse visible in the contiguous United States will be on Aug. 23, 2044.Lunar eclipses occur during the full moon phase, and solar eclipses occur during the new moon phase.We can't normally see the corona \u2013\u2014the Sun's outer atmosphere \u2014 because Sun's surface below it is so much brighter. But during a total solar eclipse, the corona emerges, offering unique opportunities to study it.An eclipse season is one of only two periods during each year when the Sun, the Moon and Earth are aligned, allowing eclipses to occur. Each season lasts about 35 days and repeats just short of six months later!Featured StoryThe April 8 Total Solar Eclipse: Through the Eyes of NASAOn April 8, 2024, the Moon\u2019s shadow swept across North America, treating millions to a breathtaking view of a total\u2026Read the StorySafetyCitizen ScienceEclipse TypesScienceHistoryEye Safety During an EclipseObserving our star, the Sun, can be safe and inspirational.Except for a specific and brief period of time during a total solar eclipse, you must never look directly at the Sun without proper eye protection, such as safe solar viewing glasses (eclipse glasses). Eclipse glasses are NOT the same as regular sunglasses; regular sunglasses are not safe for viewing the Sun. During a total solar eclipse, you must wear your eclipse glasses (or use other solar filters) to view the Sun directly during the partial eclipse phase. You can only take your glasses off during the short time when the Moon completely obscures the Sun \u2013 known as the period of totality. If you don\u2019t have eclipse glasses, you can use an indirect viewing method, such as a pinhole projector, which projects an image of the Sun onto a nearby surface.It is safe to look at the Moon with unprotected eyes or through a telescope during all types and during all stages of a lunar eclipse.Learn MoreA family wearing eclipse glasses watches the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017.",
