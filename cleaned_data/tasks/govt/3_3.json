  "gold_answer": "Contrary to popular belief, groundwater is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Instead, water fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments beneath the Earth's surface, similar to how water saturates a sponge or towel. Only 3.5 percent of the water on Earth is fresh water suitable for drinking, and most of that, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers. One-third of the freshwater is found in the ground, known as groundwater.",

      "text": "FAQs \u2022 Where do groundwater toxins come from?\nThe water is imported for us by the San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District, a public agency, and of which the City of Monterey Park is a member.\t\n\n4.\nHow much water does the Monterey Park community use?\n\r\nUsage ranges from an average low of 7.3 million gallons per day (mgd) in February to an average high of 12 mgd in August. Average use per person is 100-110 gallons per day.\t\n\n5.\nWhat is ground water?\n\r\nContrary to what a lot of people think, groundwater is not found in underground rivers or lakes. Rather, it is water that fills the cracks and pore spaces in rocks and sediments that lie beneath the surface of the earth, much the way water fills the open spaces and saturates a sponge or towel. \t\n\n6.\nWhy is keeping our groundwater clean so important?\n\r\nThe San Gabriel Valley is unique in that it is one of the few natural underground reservoirs in the United States. Rain and snowmelt comes down from the San Gabriel Mountains through a series of dams and are then diverted to \"spreading basins\". Spreading basins are designated areas of land that are very permeable, such as sand and gravel areas. Water can then percolate into the ground. 100% of the water served to residents and businesses in Monterey Park comes from groundwater. Thus, keeping our groundwater resource clean is vitally important to all of us. \t\n\n7.\nWhere do groundwater toxins come from?\n\r\nMany products we use around our homes everyday are considered toxic, such as household cleaners, flea powders, garden pesticides, paints, varnishes, motor oil, and antifreeze. These products are not only hazardous to our health, but to our environment. By disposing these harmful products improperly, we are contributing to the groundwater contamination in the San Gabriel Valley.\t\n\n8.\nCan contaminated groundwater be cleaned up?\n\r\nYes, but it can be time-consuming and expensive. Communities whose drinking water source has become contaminated have had to spend millions of dollars to remove contaminants from the water before it can be piped to homes and businesses. The cleanup is effective, but it can significantly affect the cost of providing the water to customers.",

It\u2019s in the ground, forms big oceans, and it\u2019s in our atmosphere.\nIt\u2019s also in living things. Your body is made up mostly of water.\nWater covers 71 percent of Earth\u2019s surface. And almost all of it\u201496.5 percent\u2014is salt water. \nSalt water has different kinds of salt in it, but it mostly has sodium chloride, the same salt we add to our food.\nJust 3.5 percent of the water on Earth is fresh water we can drink. And most of that fresh water, 68 percent, is trapped in ice and glaciers.\nA third of the fresh water is in the ground. We call it groundwater. The last two percent of fresh water is in the rivers, lakes, and streams.\nA very small amount is in our atmosphere, where it exists as water vapor. That\u2019s what clouds are made of.\nIf you took all the water on Earth and put it together it would be a ball 860 miles wide.
