    "text": "The document discusses several infectious diseases that can affect animals, including chronic wasting disease (CWD), plague, and West Nile virus. CWD is a slow-progressing neurological disease that affects deer, elk, and moose, and is caused by a misfolded prion protein. Plague is a severe bacterial infection that can affect humans and other mammals, and is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected flea or by handling infected animals. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause fever, headache, and muscle weakness in humans, and can also infect birds, horses, and other animals.",

        "text": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a sporadic prion disease arising in 1:1,000,000 people, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has been linked to the consumption of infected cattle during the \u201cmad cow disease\u201d outbreak in Great Britain and Europe in the 1990s, are examples of TSEs in humans.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease spread?\n\nThe misfolded prion that causes CWD is infectious to other cervids and can be spread through direct contact with infected individuals or through contact with a contaminated environment. Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34\u00a0states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces. It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.\u00a0For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?",

In humans there are several known coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections. These coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19.\nTop of PageCoronavirus Disease 2019:\nEmergence\nCOVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market; however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases occurred.\nTransmission\nThere are three main ways that COVID-19 can spread:\n\nBy breathing in air carrying droplets or aerosol particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus when close to an infected person or in poorly ventilated spaces with infected persons\nBy having droplets and particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth \u2013 especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze\nBy touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles on them\n\nThe droplets that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is recommended by the WHO to avoid infection,1 whereas CDC recommends maintaining a physical distance of at least 1.8 meters (6ft) between persons.",

Plague occurs naturally in the western United States and is transmitted by the bite of an infected flea, handling infected animals, or inhaling droplets from the cough of an infected person or animal. Plague in humans can require strict isolation and disinfection procedures for infected individuals. The disease is rare in the United States, with an average of seven cases reported each year. Exposure to plague is typically limited to the western and southwestern parts of the country.\n\nFacts\n\nPlague Fact Sheet\nCDC Plague Fact Sheet\n\nInformation for Health Care Providers\n\nProfessional Reporting Requirements\nReporting Form (PDF389)\nPlague Information for Health Professionals - CDC\n\nNYS Resources\n\nWhat to do if you think you or someone you know may have a communicable disease",

West Nile virus has been reported in all lower 48 states, with the highest number of cases occurring in states with warm, humid climates.\nAs for the symptoms, CWD causes infected animals to gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \"wasted\" despite continuing to eat, and may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up. Plague can cause fever, chills, headache, and weakness, and can progress to severe pneumonia if left untreated. West Nile virus can cause fever, headache, and muscle weakness, and in severe cases, can lead to meningitis or encephalitis.\nRegarding prevention, for CWD, it is recommended to avoid feeding or watering deer and elk in areas where CWD has been found, and to properly dispose of carcasses and tissues of infected animals. For plague, it is recommended to use insect repellent, wear long pants and sleeves, and avoid contact with wild rodents and their burrows. For West Nile virus, it is recommended to use insect repellent, wear long pants and sleeves, and"
