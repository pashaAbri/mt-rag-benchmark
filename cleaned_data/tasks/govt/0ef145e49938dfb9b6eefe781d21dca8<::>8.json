        "text": "Identity Theft Awareness - Privacy\nThe following are successful strategies for safeguarding your identity when away from home.\nClean out your wallet. Before you travel, plan to carry only the necessities for your trip and nothing extra. This way, if your wallet gets misplaced or stolen during your travels, you will have reduced the number of things that need to be replaced, as well as the amount of personal information that could be at risk.\nCopy and disperse copies of your identification. Do not keep all your identification or important documents in one location while you are traveling. Carry a photocopy of your passport in a different bag than your actual passport in case your passport gets lost or stolen during your trip. Having a photocopy and another form of identification available will be important if a passport needs to be replaced.\nLock up any valuables. If you are staying in a hotel, do not leave valuables or personal information out in the open. Be sure they are placed in your room\u2019s safe. If your room does not have a safe, ask the hotel to lock up your valuables at the front desk. It is prudent to do this even if you are only going out for a few hours.\nSign out of your accounts. When you are traveling away from home, you might end up using a public computer at a hotel to check into your flight or to check your email. Make sure to sign out of any programs or accounts you use on public or shared computers before you walk away. Forgetting to do so can mean the next user can have access to your personal information.\nBe aware of your belongings. As tempting as it may be to rest your eyes on a plane, train, or bus, make sure you are vigilant about your belongings and your surroundings when using public transportation. Falling asleep could make you a potential target for theft.\nKeep laptops and other devices close. The airport security conveyor belt is a common place for laptop theft. Only place your computer on the belt when you are next in line, and always keep your eyes on it.\nWrite down important contact information. Keep a written copy or photocopy of important contact information, including your credit card company\u2019s phone number, with you while you travel.",
