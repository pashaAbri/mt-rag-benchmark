    "text": "Each disaster has its characteristics, but it's important to plan and prepare today for you and your family to recover from an emergency tomorrow. Here are some steps you can take: 1. Get an Emergency Supplies kit lasting up to three days per family member, and remember supplies for your pets. 2. Make a family communication plan, including shelter-in-place and evacuation procedures. 3. Stay informed by visiting Ready.gov and signing up for emergency notifications from San Mateo County (SMC) Alert. 4. Get involved by signing up for a Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) course and learning life-saving techniques in a CPR class. Remember, earthquakes can happen suddenly and without warning. Identifying potential hazards and planning can reduce the risk of severe injury or loss of life during an earthquake. If your home is damaged, check for gas leaks and avoid using toilets if you suspect sewage lines are damaged. Contact the gas company and a plumber if needed. In the same way, if water pipes are damaged, please contact the water company and avoid using tap water. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes. Each county prone to earthquakes has guides to help citizens before, during, and after an earthquake. Please reach out to your city hall for more information.",

What will you do when one occurs? While the potential earthquake hazards you may experience depend upon your location, everywhere in California is considered at high risk compared to the rest of the country. There are a multitude of reasons you may or may not have prepared yourself, your home, or business for the occurrence of an earthquake. But you need to take the time to do it now.Safety TipsThe Monterey Park Fire Department provides the following information to inform the general public of what to do before, during,and after an earthquake. Earthquakes strike suddenly, violently and without warning. Identifying potential hazards ahead of time and advance planning can reduce the dangers of serious injury or loss of life from an earthquake.Checking Utilities in Damaged HomesCheck for gas leaks - If you smell gas or hear blowing or hissing noises, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a neighbor's home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional.Look for electrical system damage - If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice.Check for sewage and water lines damage - If you suspect sewage lines are damaged, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber. If water pipes are damaged, contact the water company and avoid using water from the tap. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes.\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\nBefore\n\nDuring\n\nAfter\n\n \n\n \n\nServices\n\nNews\n\nCalendar\n\nSubscribe\n\nContact\n\n \n \n \n\n \n\nCommunity Development\n\nEmployment\n\nLibrary\n\n \n \n\nOnline Services",

    "original_text": "The guidelines for sheltering-in-place during a disaster apply to various types of emergencies, including earthquakes. When an earthquake strikes, it's essential to find a safe location indoors, away from heavy furniture, appliances, or anything that could fall and cause injury. In some cases, local authorities may advise residents to shelter-in-place using duct tape and plastic sheeting to create a barrier to air flow, especially if there are concerns about chemical, biological, or radiological agents. However, the specific instructions and recommendations may vary depending on the nature of the emergency and the location."
