  "gold_answer": "The Court of Appeal's judgment usually includes costs on appeal. In most instances, if a party prevails on appeal, they can request the other party to cover their court costs. In some cases, the winning party may also request the other party to cover their attorney fees. - After the court issues a remittitur (the final step in an appeal), the prevailing party can file a memorandum of costs in the trial court. The trial court will handle the request and notify the parties about the next steps. - If the parties have questions regarding reimbursement of appeal costs, they can contact the trial court. There are fees in both the trial court and the Court of Appeal during an appeal. If you wish to have your fees waived in both courts, you must obtain a fee waiver.",

A majority of the justices \u2013 or two of the three justices \u2013 must agree on a decision.\nWhat\u2019s in the Written Decision\nRegardless of what the Court of Appeal justices decide, they issue an order or opinion in writing. Generally, the court justices must provide an opinion with reasons why they made the decision. The court justices are not required to provide an opinion if they issue an order dismissing the appeal.\nMost often there is one written statement signed by all of the justices. Sometimes a justice will file an additional opinion. This can either be a concurrence (written by a justice who agrees with the decision) or a dissent (written by a justice who does not agree with the decision).\nHow the Court Notifies the Parties\nWhen the Court of Appeal makes a decision, the court clerk sends notice of the court\u2019s opinion or order to all parties in the case. If a party does not have a lawyer, the court sends notice to the party. If a party has a lawyer, the court sends notice to their lawyer.\nAsking for Reimbursement of Court Costs\nThe Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion usually awards costs on appeal.\nIn most cases, a party who wins an appeal can ask the other party to pay for their court costs. In some cases, a party who wins may also be able to ask the other party to pay for their attorney fees.\nAfter the court issues a remittitur (the final step in an appeal), the winning party can file a memorandum of costs in the trial court. The trial court will process the request and send notice to the parties about next steps. If the parties have questions about reimbursement of appeal costs, they can contact the trial court.",
