Formally started in NASA's FY 1994 budget, the Discovery program featured small planetary exploration spacecraft with focused science goals that could be built in 36 months or less, for less than $190 million in development costs and a total mission cost of less than $299 million. The program has expanded since then, but still concentrates on smaller missions that require less resources and shorter development times than the larger \"flagship\" missions. For instance the NSSDCA - Spacecraft cost mission was $220.5 million, which included $43.5 million for the launch vehicle and $60.8 million for mission operations after launch.",

It is important to note that Juno is preparing the way for future visitors such as ESA\u2019s Juice mission (JUpiter ICy moons Explorer), launched in April 2023 and scheduled to reach Jupiter in July 2031.

Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.\n|user|: Could you tell me about the most important discoveries that Juno did in its way to Jupiter and also what it found in that huge planet?\n|assistant|:  NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno\u2019s transition into a full Jovian system explorer.Now in its extended mission, Juno will continue its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft\u2019s end of life. This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .\n|user|: By the way, how are the cyclones on earth formed?\n|assistant|: Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?\n|assistant|: No, the cyclones on Jupiter cannot affect the Earth or cause damage to cities and people. This is because Jupiter is very far away from Earth, with an average distance of about 5.3 astronomical units (AU) or 778 million kilometers.Only the belts and zones of Jupiter extend about 1,900 mile(3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Additionally, Jupiter does not have a solid surface for the storms to make landfall on, unlike Earth. The cyclones on Jupiter are also different from those on Earth in terms of their formation and behavior, as they are driven by different atmospheric conditions and dynamic.They travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on earth.\n|user|:  For now does Nasa scientists have  plans to send new spacecrafts to other planets beside Jupiter?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA has plans to send new spacecraft to other planets besides Jupiter.For instance, the Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030, with the goal of searching for life-sustaining conditions exising below the surface of Jupiter\u2019s fourth largest moon, Europ. An interesting fact is that Europa Clipper spacecraft will carry a richly layered dispatch that includes more than 2.6 million names submitted by the public.  Additionally, the Dragonfly mission will send a rotorcraft lander to explore a variety of locations on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan in 2028.\n|user|: Those mission to space searching for new discoveries on planets like Jupiter, Saturn must cost a lot money .

        "text": "Juno - NASA Science\nThe self-destruct maneuver would have satisfied NASA\u2019s planetary protection requirements, avoiding any chance Juno could crash into the Jovian moons Europa, Ganymede, or Callisto \u2013 ocean worlds, with Europa in particular considered a prime candidate in the search for life beyond Earth \u2013 and contaminate them with microscopic life from Earth.\u00a0\u00a0The Cassini mission, orbiting Saturn from 2004 to 2017, prompted similar concerns \u2013 protecting the integrity of Saturn\u2019s moons Enceladus and Titan, also believed to contain possibly habitable environments. As a grand finale, the mission team plunged Cassini through the rings and into Saturn, collecting science until the end.\u00a0The same fate befell NASA\u2019s Galileo orbiter \u2013 Juno\u2019s predecessor to Jupiter from 1995-2003, and the mission that discovered the possibility of a subsurface ocean on Europa. That hardy spacecraft endured more than four times its designed radiation exposure, but was running out of fuel when placed on a collision course with Jupiter in September 2003. The possibility of life existing on Europa compelled protection for that icy moon, as well as plans for future investigations.\u00a0\u00a0With Juno, however, the evolution of its flight path in the extended mission meant that it no longer posed a risk to contaminate these ocean worlds, now beyond its reach. The spacecraft will continue its exploration of Jupiter, its ring system, and moons through September 2025. Then Juno\u2019s orbit will degrade naturally, and Jupiter\u2019s gravity will pull the spacecraft in to be consumed in the atmosphere.\u00a0Legacy and ImpactIn its extended mission, NASA\u2019s most distant planetary orbiter continues its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet.

Galileo deployment from space shuttle Atlantis, October 1989.\n|user|: Could you tell me about the most important discoveries that Juno did in its way to Jupiter and also what it found in that huge planet?\n|assistant|:  NASA's Juno mission has made several significant discoveries since was launched that have changed the view of Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere and interior, revealing an atmospheric weather layer that extends far beyond its water clouds and a deep interior with a dilute heavy element core. Near the end of the prime mission, as the spacecraft\u2019s orbit evolved, flybys of the moon Ganymede initiated Juno\u2019s transition into a full Jovian system explorer.Now in its extended mission, Juno will continue its investigation of the solar system\u2019s largest planet through September 2025, or until the spacecraft\u2019s end of life. This extension tasks Juno with becoming an explorer of the full Jovian system \u2013 Jupiter and its rings and moons \u2013 with additional rendezvous planned for two of Jupiter\u2019s most intriguing moons: Europa and Io. Juno primary mission completed by mid-2021, offered revelations about Jupiter\u2019s interior structure, atmosphere (including polar cyclones, deep atmosphere, and auroras), and magnetosphere \u2013 the vast region around the planet influenced by Jupiter's uniquely intense magnetic field. Furthermore  the Juno close passes, on Dec. 30, 2023, and Feb. 3, 2024, allowed scientists to compare data and images from these visits with previous observations that Juno and other craft made of this volatile world, slightly larger than Earth's Moon. Io is caught in a tug-of-war between Jupiter's powerful gravity and the smaller pull from two neighboring moons, churning its insides and creating eruptions and lakes of lava that cover its surface. \n|user|: What about the major discoveries made by the spacecraft Galileo?\n|assistant|: The Galileo spacecraft, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, made several significant discoveries about the planet. One of its most notable findings was the discovery of evidence of an ocean under Europa's planetary ice sheet and possibly under two other moons as well; determined that the moon Ganymede has a magnetic field; and spotted the first asteroid moon, Dactyl, orbiting main belt asteroid 243 Ida in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. The Galileo mission also becomes notable for discoveries during its journey to the gas giant. It is the first spacecraft to visit an asteroid, called Gaspra. Galileo also provided the only close observations of a comet colliding with a planet when it witnesses fragments of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 impact Jupiter. It is important to note that Galileo mission consists of two spacecraft: (1) investigate the circulation and dynamics of the Jovian atmosphere; (2) investigate the upper Jovian atmosphere and ionosphere; (3) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the Galilean satellites; (4) investigate the composition and distribution of surface minerals on the Galilean satellites; (5) determine the gravitational and magnetic fields and dynamic properties of the Galilean satellites; (6) study the atmospheres, ionospheres, and extended gas clouds of the Galilean satellites; (7) study the interaction of the Jovian magnetosphere with the Galilean satellites; and, (8) characterize the vector magnetic field and the energy spectra, composition, and angular distribution of energetic particles and plasma to a distance of 150 Rj.\n|user|: were Juno and Galileo able to find out if Jupiter has cyclones?\n|assistant|: Yes. From JunoCam some images of individual cyclones near the north pole were are able to see. The complete picture surprised researchers, showing a pinwheel of complementary storms twirling around a central vortex. Others had more whimsical takes on the JunoCam views, turning Jupiter\u2019s swirls into artwork that echoes Monet or VanGogh, or adding dreamlike figures or stark geometrics.  That cyclone at the north pole was surrounded by eight more, as if they\u2019re bowing in tribute. These cyclones stretched more than 2,500 miles across (4,000 kilometers). And though their spiral arms smack together as they spin, the storms did not merge. During a close flyby of the south pole, Juno spotted a new, giant cyclone in the region. A pattern of six cyclones, with one in the center, had seemed locked in place at the south pole, but a new maelstrom had somehow muscled in as Jupiter had an intense magnetic .\n|user|: By the way, how are the cyclones on earth formed?\n|assistant|: Cyclones also known as hurricanes or typhoons depending on their location are the most violent storms on our planet. They are formed due to several conditions. They typically begin over warm ocean waters, near the equator. The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward, creating an area of low pressure below. Surrounding air then rushes in to fill this low-pressure area, causing the air to spin and form a cyclonic storm. As the air continues to rise and cool, it forms thunderstorms and heavy rain. The storm system can grow in size and strength if conditions remain favorable, such as warm sea surface temperatures and weak vertical wind shear.When the winds in the rotating storm reach 39 mph, the storm is called a \"tropical storm.\" And when the wind speeds reach 74 mph, the storm is officially a \"tropical cyclone,\" or hurricane. Tropical cyclones usually weaken when they hit land, because they are no longer being \"fed\" by the energy from the warm ocean waters. However, they often move far inland, dumping many inches of rain and causing lots of wind damage before they die out completely. The specific process of cyclone formation on Jupiter may differ from the one on Earth due to the planet's unique atmospheric conditions and lack of a solid surface.\n|user|: Is it possible that those cyclones on Jupiter can affect the planet Earth and do damage as the earthy cyclones do destroying cities and  kill people?\n|assistant|: No, the cyclones on Jupiter cannot affect the Earth or cause damage to cities and people. This is because Jupiter is very far away from Earth, with an average distance of about 5.3 astronomical units (AU) or 778 million kilometers.Only the belts and zones of Jupiter extend about 1,900 mile(3,000 kilometers) below the cloud tops. Additionally, Jupiter does not have a solid surface for the storms to make landfall on, unlike Earth. The cyclones on Jupiter are also different from those on Earth in terms of their formation and behavior, as they are driven by different atmospheric conditions and dynamic.They travel deep into the heart of the gas giant, and a mammoth, lumpy magnetic field far more powerful than the strongest magnetic field found on earth.\n|user|:  For now does Nasa scientists have  plans to send new spacecrafts to other planets beside Jupiter?\n|assistant|: Yes, NASA has plans to send new spacecraft to other planets besides Jupiter.For instance, the Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in October 2024 and enter orbit around Jupiter in April 2030, with the goal of searching for life-sustaining conditions exising below the surface of Jupiter\u2019s fourth largest moon, Europ. An interesting fact is that Europa Clipper spacecraft will carry a richly layered dispatch that includes more than 2.6 million names submitted by the public.  Additionally, the Dragonfly mission will send a rotorcraft lander to explore a variety of locations on Saturn\u2019s moon Titan in 2028.\n|user|: Those mission to space searching for new discoveries on planets like Jupiter, Saturn must cost a lot money . How much  are we talking about and who financial them?"
