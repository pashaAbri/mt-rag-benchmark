        "text": "\r\n\tChronic Wasting Disease\r\n\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a sporadic prion disease arising in 1:1,000,000 people, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which has been linked to the consumption of infected cattle during the \u201cmad cow disease\u201d outbreak in Great Britain and Europe in the 1990s, are examples of TSEs in humans.\n\nHow is chronic wasting disease spread?\n\nThe misfolded prion that causes CWD is infectious to other cervids and can be spread through direct contact with infected individuals or through contact with a contaminated environment. Infectious prions can be excreted in urine, feces, and saliva of infected animals, even before they show any signs of the disease. Carcasses and tissues, especially brain, spinal cord, and lymph nodes, of infected animals contain infectious prions and may spread the disease if left out on the landscape. Prions are very stable and difficult to disinfect, persisting for years in a contaminated environment able to infect a susceptible deer or elk.\n\nWhere is chronic wasting disease?\n\nChronic wasting disease (CWD) was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967. Since then, CWD has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34\u00a0states (now including California) and four Canadian provinces. It has also been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.\u00a0For a map of current known CWD infected populations in North America, please visit the United States Geological Survey (USGS) CWD page. A timeline of the spread of CWD can be found by visiting the Chronic Wasting Disease Alliance website.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of chronic wasting disease?\n\nThe progression of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in an infected animal is very slow. It takes months or even years following infection for clinical signs of CWD to appear. Infected animals gradually become skinnier, emaciated or \u201cwasted\u201d despite continuing to eat. They may show abnormal behaviors such as a wide stance, staggering gait, or inability to keep their head up.\n\nWhat should I do if I see a sick deer or elk and am concerned it might be chronic wasting disease?",

CWD is a slow-progressing neurological disease that affects deer, elk, and moose, and is caused by a misfolded prion protein. Plague is a severe bacterial infection that can affect humans and other mammals, and is typically transmitted through the bite of an infected flea or by handling infected animals. West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause fever, headache, and muscle weakness in humans, and can also infect birds, horses, and other animals.\n|user|: are these regionally affected?\n|assistant|: Yes, these animal infectious diseases are regionally affected. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) has been diagnosed in free-ranging deer, elk, and moose populations in 34 states and four Canadian provinces. West Nile virus has been reported in nearly 44,000 cases in the United States since 1999, with some states reporting more cases than others. Plague is most commonly found in the western United States, particularly in rural areas. Regarding the regional distribution of CWD, it was first described in mule deer at a captive facility in Colorado in 1967.  Additionally, it has been found in captive elk and Sika deer in South Korea, free-ranging moose and reindeer in Norway, and free-ranging moose in Finland.  \n|user|: With warming trend, West Niles virus can survive winter and more spreads in singht?"

Depending on the year, some states report more West Nile cases than others. Some areas of the United States also report cases of other viruses spread by mosquitoes, such as Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus or La Crosse Encephalitis Virus.Though anyone can get infected with West Nile virus, some people are at higher risk for infection of the brain or spinal cord. For example, people over the age of 50 are at higher risk for encephalitis (swelling of the brain).What are the symptoms of a West Nile virus infection?No Symptoms in Most PeopleMost people (70-80%) who become infected with West Nile virus do not have any symptoms.Fever in Some PeopleAbout 1 in 5 people who are infected will develop a fever with other symptoms such as headache, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash. Most people with this type of West Nile virus recover completely, but feeling tired and weak can last for weeks to months.Severe Symptoms in a Few PeopleLess than 1% of people who are infected will develop a serious neurologic illness such as encephalitis or meningitis (inflammation of the lining of the brain and spinal cord). The symptoms of neurologic illness can include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, tremors, seizures, or paralysis. See your healthcare provider if you think you have symptoms of West Nile virus.\n\n \n \n\n \n \n \n\nWhy risk a severe illness this summer?",

        "text": "Global Warming\nEven if greenhouse gas concentrations stabilized today, the planet would continue to warm by about 0.6\u00b0C over the next century because of greenhouses gases already in the atmosphere.\nSee Earth\u2019s Big Heat Bucket, Correcting Ocean Cooling, and Climate Q&A: If we immediately stopped emitting greenhouse gases, would global warming stop? to learn more about the ocean heat and global warming.\n\nHow Will Global Warming Change Earth?\nThe impact of increased surface temperatures is significant in itself. But global warming will have additional, far-reaching effects on the planet. Warming modifies rainfall patterns, amplifies coastal erosion, lengthens the growing season in some regions, melts ice caps and glaciers, and alters the ranges of some infectious diseases. Some of these changes are already occurring.\n\nGlobal warming will shift major climate patterns, possibly prolonging and intensifying the current drought in the U.S. Southwest. The white ring of bleached rock on the once-red cliffs that hold Lake Powell indicate the drop in water level over the past decade\u2014the result of repeated winters with low snowfall. (Photograph \u00a92006 Tigresblanco.)\n\nChanging Weather\nFor most places, global warming will result in more frequent hot days and fewer cool days, with the greatest warming occurring over land. Longer, more intense heat waves will become more common. Storms, floods, and droughts will generally be more severe as precipitation patterns change. Hurricanes may increase in intensity due to warmer ocean surface temperatures.\n\nApart from driving temperatures up, global warming is likely to cause bigger, more destructive storms, leading to an overall increase in precipitation. With some exceptions, the tropics will likely receive less rain (orange) as the planet warms, while the polar regions will receive more precipitation (green). White areas indicate that fewer than two-thirds of the climate models agreed on how precipitation will change. Stippled areas reveal where more than 90 percent of the models agreed. (\u00a92007 IPCC WG1 AR-4.)\n\nIt is impossible to pin any single unusual weather event on global warming, but emerging evidence suggests that global warming is already influencing the weather.",
