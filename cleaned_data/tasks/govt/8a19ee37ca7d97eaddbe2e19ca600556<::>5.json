In an effort to educate the public on what plastics can and cannot be recycled, we have moved our messaging away from using the #1-7 symbols. These numbers reflect the type of plastic used to make a product and does not mean that an item can be recycled. Instead, our messaging focuses on the shape of the material such as plastic bottles/jugs that have a \"neck\" or taper at the top and plastic dairy tubs.",

The container recycling bin, on the other hand, is for accepting plastic bottles and jugs, glass bottles and jars, aluminum cans, and metal food containers and lids. It is important to note that plastic bags, plastic clamshell containers, and plastic toys are not accepted in either bin. Additionally, all recyclables must be empty, clean, and dry."
