  "gold_answer": "In most cases, the appellate court considers two main points: whether a legal mistake was made in the trial court and whether this mistake affected the final decision (referred to as the \"judgment\"). The appellate court only reviews what happened in the trial court to determine if a legal mistake occurred in the original trial. An appeal is a process through which a case is moved from a lower court to a higher court for review or reconsideration after the lower court has issued a judgment. The higher or appellate court may uphold, reverse, or modify the decision.",

For example, to see if the trial court judge applied the wrong law to the facts of the case.\nThe appellate court cannot change the trial court's decision just because the appellate court judges (called justices in the Court of Appeal) disagree with it\nThe trial court is entitled to hear the evidence and come to its own decision. The appellate court can only reverse the trial court's decision if it finds a legal mistake in the trial court proceedings that was so important that it changed at least part of the outcome of the case. Because of this heavy burden on the appellant to prove this type of mistake, it is quite difficult to win an appeal.\nFiling an appeal does not stop the trial court's order\nUnless you ask the trial or appellate court to postpone (\"stay\") the trial court's order, you must do what the trial court's order requires you to do during the appeal. A request for a stay can be complicated, and you may still have to pay some of the money ordered by the trial court upfront. Ask a lawyer if one of these options would be good in your case and get help. But remember that an appeal is not a way to put off having to comply with the trial court's order.\n\nOverview of civil appeals\n\nIf you're considering an appeal, read through each section to get an idea of your options and what you'll have to do if you do decide to appeal. Appeals are very complicated, so also talk to a lawyer.\u00a0\n\nAppellate court basics",

Most appeals are limited to a review of the record from the lower court. Parties cannot introduce new \r\n evidence, but are limited to what was said and introduced at the original trial. The appellate court reviews the lower court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s application of the law to the facts as presented \r\n at the trial.\nSome appeals do allow for a new trial without reference to the evidence submitted in the original proceeding. Such an appeal results in a trial de novo, meaning a trial \r\n from the beginning. Appeals from small claims court result in a trial de novo in the Superior court. The superior court judge is not bound by the decision of the small claims \r\n judge, and new evidence can be presented.\n\nInformation on Appeal Types\n\nSmall Claims Appeals\n\nAppeal after being present at trial\nIn small claims court an appeal results in a trial de novo, meaning a trial from the beginning, conducted in the Superior Court. Therefore, all evidence presented at the \r\n small claims trial must be presented again in the Superior Court at the trial de novo. Only a Superior Court judge will hear a trial de novo; no pro tem or temporary judge \r\n hears small claims appeals.\r\n\r\n Only the defendant, or a plaintiff who was counter sued as a cross-defendant and lost on the cross-complaint, can appeal a small claims case. A plaintiff cannot file an \r\n appeal. The defendant or cross-defendant must have been present at the time of trial in order to appeal the decision.\nAny of the parties may choose to have an attorney represent him, her or it at the trial de novo. Unlike in regular superior court cases, an attorney is not required to \r\n represent a corporation at a trial de novo.",
