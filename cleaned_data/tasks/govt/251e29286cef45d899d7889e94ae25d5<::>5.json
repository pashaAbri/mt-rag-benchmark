In humans there are several known coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections. These coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and COVID-19.\nTop of PageCoronavirus Disease 2019:\nEmergence\nCOVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person. Early in the outbreak, many patients were reported to have a link to a large seafood and live animal market; however, later cases with no link to the market confirmed person-to-person transmission of the disease. Additionally, travel-related exportation of cases occurred.\nTransmission\nThere are three main ways that COVID-19 can spread:\n\nBy breathing in air carrying droplets or aerosol particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus when close to an infected person or in poorly ventilated spaces with infected persons\nBy having droplets and particles that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus land on the eyes, nose, or mouth \u2013 especially through splashes and sprays like a cough or sneeze\nBy touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with hands that have the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles on them\n\nThe droplets that contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus are released when someone with COVID-19 sneezes, coughs, or talks. Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is recommended by the WHO to avoid infection,1 whereas CDC recommends maintaining a physical distance of at least 1.8 meters (6ft) between persons.",

Infectious droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. A physical distance of at least 1 meter (3 ft) between persons is recommended by the WHO to avoid infection,1 whereas CDC recommends maintaining a physical distance of at least 1.8 meters (6ft) between persons. Respiratory droplets can land on hands, objects, or surfaces around the person when they cough or talk, and people can then become infected with COVID-19 from touching hands, objects or surfaces with droplets and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Additionally, transmission can occur from those with mild symptoms or from those who do not feel ill.\nThere are certain circumstances that can increase the risk of infection for COVID-19 such as poorly ventilated space. In indoor spaces with poor ventilation, the concentration of virus particles is often higher than outdoors.2,3 Other factors that are associated with increased COVID-19 risk include prolonged exposure to those infected with COVID-19, close contact with infected persons, and any other activity that leads to exposure to a greater amount of respiratory droplets and particles.\nSymptoms\nA wide range of symptoms for COVID-19 have been reported.4 These symptoms include:\n\nFever or chills\nCough\nMuscle or body aches\nAnorexia\nSore throat\nNasal congestion or runny nose\nHeadache\nDiarrhea\nNausea\nShortness of breath or difficulty breathing\nLoss of smell or taste\n\nThe estimated incubation period is between 2 and 14 days with a median of 5 days. It is important to note that some people become infected and do not develop any symptoms or feel ill.\nPeople at Higher Risk for Severe Illness\nCOVID-19 is a relatively new disease; therefore, additional risk factors for severe COVID-19 may continue to be identified. In some cases, people who get COVID-19 can develop severe complications, including difficulty breathing, causing a need for hospitalization and intensive care. 5 These severe complications often lead to death.",
