NASA\u2019s reaction was to envision a steady stream of missions to Mars \u2014 all done at cut-rate costs. In fact, the next challenge taken on by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory was to fly two missions to Mars for the price of the single Pathfinder mission. Mars Climate Orbiter and the Mars Polar Lander both made it to the launch pad, on time and on budget, but were lost upon arrival at Mars, resulting in one of the most difficult periods in the history of JPL. The Breaking Point tells the story of the demise of these two missions and the abrupt end of NASA\u2019s Faster, Better, Cheaper.View episode \u203aEpisode 10: Saving GalileoIf any spacecraft could be said to have had nine lives, it was Galileo. At the time of its launch, this mission to Jupiter was the most sophisticated science spacecraft ever built. But the expectation of great science rewards almost was ruined when the spacecraft\u2019s main antenna refused to unfurl. Saving Galileo is the story of how NASA\u2019s Galileo mission \u2014 designed, built and operated by NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory \u2014 was kept alive despite a multitude of technical challenges, including a years-long launch delay after the loss of the space shuttle Challenger and then the devastating failure of its main antenna following the spacecraft\u2019s launch. It is also the story of a tight-knit team of scientists and engineers who were forged by adversity into what many came to call a family.",

The team at \nJohns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory and its \nmany partner institutions are to be congratulated for \nachieving this historic first in space exploration.\"\n\nDuring its 5-year, 2-billion-mile journey, the NEAR Shoemaker \nmission, which was built and is managed by The Applied \nPhysics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, MD, provided the most \ndetailed profile yet of a small celestial body. It began a \nyearlong orbit of Eros on Feb. 14, 2000, and has collected 10 \ntimes more data than originally planned.\n\nThe data include a detailed shape-model culled from more than \n11 million laser pulses; radar and laser data on Eros' weak \ngravity and solid but cracked interior; X-ray, gamma-ray and \ninfrared readings on its composition and spectral properties; \nand about 160,000 images covering all of the 21-mile-long \nasteroid's bouldered, cratered, dusty terrain.",

    "original_text": "Sure, here's a brief overview of another mission that is part of NASA's Discovery Program - the Kepler Space Telescope:\nThe Kepler Space Telescope is a space observatory launched by NASA in 2009 to discover Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. It was the first mission of NASA's Discovery Program to search for exoplanets using the transit method, where the telescope measures the dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it.\nKepler's primary mission was to survey a portion of the sky in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra, searching for planets in the habitable zone of their host stars, where liquid water could exist on the surface. The mission was highly successful, discovering over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets and thousands of additional planet candidates during its lifetime.\nThe Kepler mission ended in 2018, but its legacy continues through the K2 mission and other exoplanet hunting projects. The data collected by Kepler has significantly advanced our understanding of the prevalence and diversity of exoplanets in the galaxy, and has paved the way for future missions to study these planets in greater detail."
