Click the Dialog tab, and then click Create dialog.\n\nWhen you open the dialog editor for the first time, the following nodes are created for you:\n\n\n\n* Welcome: The first node. It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users. For example, dialogs that are deployed in environments such as messaging channels where customers start the conversation do not process nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\n2. To add more nodes to the dialog tree, click the More![More icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/kabob.png) icon on the Welcome node, and then select Add node below.\n3. In the If assistant recognizes field, enter a condition that, when met, triggers your assistant to process the node.\n\nTo start off, you typically want to add an intent as the condition. For example, if you add open_account here, it means that you want the response that you will specify in this node to be returned to the user if the user input indicates that the user wants to open an account.\n\nAs you begin to define a condition, a box is displayed that shows you your options. You can enter one of the following characters, and then pick a value from the list of options that is displayed.\n\n\n\nCondition builder syntax\n\n Character Lists defined values for these artifact types \n\n `#` intents",

The client application sends a message containing user input that asks for a weather forecast (using the message or message_stateless method).\n2. The user input triggers a dialog node conditioned on a #weather intent. In its response to the client, this node specifies the get_weather client action, which is a name that the client application recognizes. (This is in addition to any text response, such as Checking the weather forecast....)\n3. When it receives this response, the client application recognizes that the get_weather action is being requested. It calls an external web service (/weather) to get the actual forecast information, passing any specified parameters (such as the user's location). The client application then stores the returned information in context variable specified in the action request ($weather_forecast).\n4. The client application sends another message to the service, including the updated context that contains the weather forecast information. From the dialog's perspective, this message is effectively the next round of user input, although the actual input text is blank.\n5. A child node of the #weather node is triggered by the presence of the $weather_forecast context variable.",
