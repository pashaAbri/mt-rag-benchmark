All supported languages can be input and trained through the English interface.\n\nGB18030 compliance: GB18030 is a Chinese standard that specifies an extended code page for use in the Chinese market. This code page standard is important for the software industry because the China National Information Technology Standardization Technical Committee has mandated that any software application that is released for the Chinese market after September 1, 2001, be enabled for GB18030.

If it is necessary to change the supported language of a skill, you can do so by editing the skill's underlying JSON.\n\nTo change the skill language, take the following steps:\n\n\n\n1. Download the skill that you want to edit.\n2. Open the downloaded skill JSON file in a text editor.\n3. Search for the property named language.\n\nThe language property is set to the original language of the skill. For example, the language property is en for an English skill.\n4. Change the value of this property to the language you want to use instead. For example, change it to fr for French or de for German.\n5. Save the changes to the JSON file, and then upload the edited file, overwriting the existing skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Configuring bidirectional languages \n\nFor bidirectional languages, such as Arabic, you can change your skill preferences.\n\n\n\n1. From your skill tile, click the Actions drop-down menu, and then select Language Preferences.\n\nThis option is only available for skills that are configured to use a bidirectional language.\n2.

Languages supported include English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages.\n|user|: What are the other skills and what languages are supported for them?\n|assistant|:  1. **Actions Skill**: Actions offer step-by-step flows for a conversation and can be built by anyone. \n2. **Search Skill**: This skill is configured to search appropriate external data sources for answers to customer questions. \nThe language support for this skill is not explicitly mentioned, but since it's a part of the Watson Assistant service, it should support the same languages as the dialog skill.\n|user|: how many skills can I create?\n|assistant|: The number of skills you can create depends on your Watson Assistant plan type. Any sample dialog skills that are available for you to use do not count toward your limit unless you use them. A skill version does not count as a skill: - Enterprise: 100 - Premium (legacy): 100 - Plus: 50 - Standard (legacy): 20 - Lite, Trial: 5 Additionally, after 30 days of inactivity, an unused skill in a Lite plan service instance might be deleted to free up space.\n|user|: What about Hebrew?\n|assistant|: Hebrew is not listed among the supported languages for building dialog skills in Watson Assistant. The supported languages include English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese. However,  you can use the universal language model when you want to create a conversation in a language for which no dedicated language model is available.\n|user|: Can it handle the reverse order of text?\n|assistant|: Yes, the universal language model can handle the reverse order of text if the skill supports a language with right-to-left directional text, such as Hebrew. You can configure the bidirectional capabilities in the skill settings to enable this feature.\n|user|: What if I forget? \n|assistant|: I cannot find information regarding what will happen if you forget to configure the bidirectional capabilities.\n|user|: how do I set it"
