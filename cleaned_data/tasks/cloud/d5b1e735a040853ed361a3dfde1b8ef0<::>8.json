  "gold_answer": "As long as you don't require more that 1 GB of data storage and comfortable with a fixed throughput capacity of 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second, you can start with a Lite plan. Additionally, if you change you mind later, you can always upgrade from a Lite to Standard plan.",

Pricing is based on provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and data storage that is used, making it suitable for any required load.\n\nThe free [Lite plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publiclite-plan) includes a fixed amount of throughput capacity and data for development and evaluation purposes. The paid [Standard plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan) offers configurable provisioned throughput capacity and data storage pricing that scales as your application requirements change. An optional [Dedicated Hardware plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicdedicated-hardware-plan) is also available for an extra monthly fee to run one or more of your Standard plan instances on a dedicated hardware environment. The dedicated hardware environment is for your sole use. If a Dedicated Hardware plan instance is provisioned within a US location, you can optionally select a [HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act) -compliant configuration.\n\n\n\n Plans \n\nYou can select which plan to use when you [provision your IBM Cloudant service instance](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicprovisioning-a-cloudant-nosql-db-instance-on-ibm-cloud). The available plans include Lite and Standard. When you select a plan, Capacity displays, and the Cost estimator shows the monthly charge for the selected plan.

All of IBM Cloudant's functions are included, but Lite plan instances have a fixed amount of provisioned throughput capacity and data storage. The provisioned throughput capacity is fixed at 20 reads per second, 10 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second, and data storage is capped at 1 GB.\n\nStorage usage is checked daily. If you exceed your 1-GB storage limit, requests to the IBM Cloudant instance receive a 402 status code with the following error message, Account exceeded its data usage quota. An upgrade to a paid plan is required. A banner also appears on the IBM Cloudant Dashboard. You can still read and delete data. However, to write new data, you have two options. First, you can upgrade to a paid [Standard plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan), which removes the write limitation immediately. Alternatively, you can delete data so that your total storage falls under the 1-GB limit and wait until the next daily storage check runs for your instance to allow writes again.\n\nIf you want to store more than one GB of data, or be able to scale provisioned throughput capacity, move to the [Standard plan](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-ibm-cloud-publicstandard-plan).\n\nYou're limited to one IBM Cloudant Lite plan instance per IBM Cloud account. If you already have one Lite plan instance, you can't create a second Lite plan instance, or change a Standard plan instance to a Lite plan. If you try, you see the following message. You can have only one instance of a Lite plan per service.",

The Standard plan is priced based on two factors: the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated, and the amount of data that is stored in the instance.\n\nPricing is pro-rated hourly with a starting provisioned throughput capacity of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. This rate is equal to a starting cost of USD $0.105 per hour. You can toggle the provisioned throughput capacity up or down by using the user interface or API. Toggle in increments of 100 reads per second, 50 writes per second, and 5 global queries per second. Costs are calculated for the provisioned throughput capacity that is allocated and not on the metered volume of requests. The Standard plan includes 20 GB of data storage. If you store more than 20 GB, you're charged a defined cost per GB per hour.\n\nRefer to the IBM Cloud Pricing Calculator in the dashboard for pricing at different capacities and currencies, and the [pricing](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Cloudant?topic=Cloudant-pricingpricing) information for examples to estimate costs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dedicated Hardware plan",
