  "gold_answer": "There are two billing plans available: Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription. 1. Pay-As-You-Go: With this account, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. Your resource usage consists of recurring and fluctuating costs. This plan is suitable for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads. You pay only for what you use or commit to on a monthly basis, with no long-term contracts. Usage consists of products, services, and resources. 2. Subscription: With this account, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs.",

      "text": "\nWhat's the difference between a Pay-As-You-Go and Subscription account? \n\nWith Pay-As-You-Go accounts, you're billed monthly for your resource usage. Your resource usage consists of recurring and fluctuating costs. This account type is a good fit for developers or companies that want to explore the entire IBM Cloud catalog but have smaller or variable workloads. You pay only for what you use or commit to on a monthly basis, with no long-term contracts. Usage consists of products, services, and resources.\n\nWith Subscription accounts, you buy a subscription for an amount of credit to spend on resource usage within a certain time period. In exchange for this spending commitment, you get a discount on your usage costs. For more information about the differences between account types, see [Account types](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts).\n\n\n\n\n\n What happens if my Lite plan instance reaches the monthly quota? \n\nWhen you reach any quota for Lite plan instances, the service for that month is suspended. Quotas are based per org and not per instance. New instances that are created in the same org show any usage from previous instances. The quota resets on the first of every month.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I use PayPal as a payment method? \n\nAs of March 31, 2023, PayPal is no longer accepted.\n\n\n\n\n\n Can I update my credit card? \n\nUpdating your credit card is just like adding a new one. Go to the [Payments](https://cloud.ibm.com/billing/payments) page in the IBM Cloud console. In the Add Payment Method section, enter the billing information for your new card, and click Add credit card.\n\nTo switch to a different payment method, select Pay with Other, and click Submit change request. A support case to change your payment method is then created for you.\n\nIf your payments are managed outside of the console, go to IBM.com and log in to the Manage Payment Method application to update your credit card. For more information, see [How do I add a credit card when the option isn't available through the console?]",
