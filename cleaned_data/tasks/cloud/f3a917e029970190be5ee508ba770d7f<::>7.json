However, the number of active rules on your site is limited by your customer plan. See the [Plan comparison](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-cis-plan-comparison) page for more information on entitlements.\n\nThe number of active rules per plan is fixed. You cannot purchase additional active rules at this time.\n\nBefore getting started, it's a good idea to become familiar with [Using fields, functions, and expressions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cis?topic=cis-fields-and-expressions).\n\n\n\n Creating a firewall rule \n\nTake the following steps to configure a basic firewall rule:\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to Security > Firewall Rules.\n2. Click Create Firewall Rule.\n3. Enter a rule name and optional description.\n4. Optionally, input a priority, if necessary. Note that a priority of zero is a null priority and is evaluated last.\n5. Use the UI builder in the Incoming requests section to add a condition. To build an expression with multiple conditions, click either:\n\n\n\n* And - to evaluate conditions using and logic\n* Or - to evaluate conditions or groups of previously and'ed conditions using or logic\n\n\n\nYou can see that as you build a condition, the Expression Preview shows the expression in plain text.\n\nIn the Expression Preview, you can click to edit your expression manually instead of using the Visual Expression Builder, or switch between the two. However, depending on the complexity of a manually constructed expression, the Visual Expression Builder might be unable to render it.\n6. Pick an action from the Response list menu.\n7. To save your rule, choose the most appropriate option by clicking either:\n\n\n\n* Save as draft to save your rule, but leave it disabled.\n* Save and deploy to save your rule and activate it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Editing a firewall rule",

CIS provides services like Global Load Balancer (GLB), Caching, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Page rule which can be configured to secure and optimize your application traffic. However, if you are restricted to using only your firewall rules, you would primarily be relying on your own firewall for security, and might not be able to leverage the advanced features of CIS."
