    "original_text": "Yes, you can use the scheduling functionality to schedule a status change to obsolete in a month and to deprecated in two months. To do this, you can use the `ibmcloud is image-update` command with the `--obsolete-at` and `--deprecate-at` options.\nFor example, if you want to schedule the image to become obsolete in a month from today, and deprecated in two months from today, you can use the following commands:\n```\nibmcloud is image-update IMAGE --obsolete-at \"YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm\"\nibmcloud is image-update IMAGE --deprecate-at \"YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm\"\n```\nReplace `IMAGE` with the name or ID of the custom image, and replace the date and time in the format of `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+hh:mm` with the desired date and time for the status change.\nPlease note that when scheduling the date and time, you can't use your current date and time. For example, if it is 8 a.m. on June 12, then the scheduled date and time must be after 8 a.m. on June 12.\nAlso, you should check the documentation for the exact date and time format required by the command.\nAnd finally, please note that you can only schedule a status change if there is no other future status change already scheduled. If you have a scheduled status change, you need to remove it first."
