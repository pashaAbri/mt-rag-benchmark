The document focuses on enhancing your chatbot's functionality by integrating it with IBM Watson Discovery for improved search and answer capabilities. To do this, you should create a Conversational Search project and add a collection that connects to an external data source or contains uploaded files.\n|user|: Does he understand my emotions?\n|assistant|: Yes, Watson Assistant has the capability to understand human emotions to some extent. However, this is not through some mystical communion with cosmic energy, but through features like Emotion Analysis in certain IBM Watson products.  It can evaluates the overall emotional tone like joy, disgust, anger, fear, and sadness in a given text. It calculates a score for each emotion on a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, and if the score of any emotion is 0.5 or higher, it is considered detected, currently though in English only.  However, it does not understand or respond to human emotions directly. It analyzes text to determine the presence and intensity of certain emotions, but it cannot perceive or react to the emotions of individual users.\n|user|: Do I have to use a certain browser to use this service?\n|assistant|: For using the IBM Cloud platform, including Watson Assistant, the minimum required browser software is specified as the latest version -1 for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox (with both regular and Extended Support Release versions), Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari.   \n|user|: exmaple words of disgust it can detect?"
