If the apps that you want Ingress to expose are in different namespaces in one cluster, register the custom domain as a wildcard domain, such as .custom_domain.net. Note that domains are limited to 130 characters or fewer in Kubernetes version 1.20 or later.\n2. Define an alias for your custom domain by specifying the IBM-provided subdomain as a Canonical Name record (CNAME). To find the IBM-provided Ingress domain, run ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster <cluster_name> and look for the Ingress subdomain field.\n\nSpecifying the IBM-provided subdomain as a CNAME is required for automatic health checks to remove any failing IPs from the DNS response, and to ensure that your custom domain updates when you add or remove ALBs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating custom domains for private ALBs \n\nFollow the steps to create a custom domain for private ALBs. Note that custom domains are required to use Ingress with private ALBs.\n\nIf you have a classic cluster with only a private VLAN, you must first configure your own [DNS service that is available on your private network](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/dns-custom-nameservers/).\n\n\n\n1. Create a custom domain through your DNS service provider. Note that Ingress URLs must be 130 characters or fewer.\n2. Map your custom domain to the private ALBs by adding their IP addresses as A records (classic clusters) or their VPC hostname as a CNAME (VPC clusters). To find the ALB IP addresses (classic) or hostname (VPC), run ibmcloud ks ingress alb ls -c <cluster_name_or_ID>.",

When you add a domain to CIS, you will be given a couple of name servers to configure at your registrar (or at your DNS provider, if you are adding a subdomain). The domain or subdomain will remain in a pending state until you configure the name servers correctly. Once the name server change has been verified (which can take up to 24 hours), your domain will be activated. You can find more information about adding a custom domain to CIS in the IBM Cloud documentation."
