        "text": "\nMobile SDK \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Functions provides a mobile SDK for iOS and watchOS devices that enables mobile apps to fire remote triggers and invoke remote actions. A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.",

However, there are no mentioned limitations of the CocoaPods method that would require switching to a different method. \n|user|: carthage?\n|assistant|: Yes, you can also use Carthage as an alternative to CocoaPods for installing the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile.  Note that this method requires manual addition of the framework to the Xcode project, unlike CocoaPods which automatically generates a workspace file for you to open the project in Xcode.\n|user|: any example of code for cart ahh sauce rather?\n|assistant|: Sure, here's an example of how to install the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile using Carthage: 1. Create a file named `Cartfile` in the project directory for your app and add the following line: `github \"openwhisk/openwhisk-client-swift.git\" > 0.3.0 Or latest version` 2. From the command line, navigate to the project directory and type `carthage update --platform ios`. Carthage will download and build the SDK, creating a directory called `Carthage` in the project directory for your app, and putting an `OpenWhisk.framework` file inside `Carthage/build/iOS`. 3. Add the `OpenWhisk.framework` file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project. \n|user|: Excuse me, I meant source code example, rather.\n|assistant|: I apologize for the misunderstanding. Here's an example of how to install the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile using Carthage from the source code:\n1. Clone the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-client-swift.git`\n2. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd openwhisk-client-swift`\n3. Install Carthage: `brew install carthage`\n4. Run `carthage bootstrap` to build the framework.\n5. Add the `OpenWhisk.framework` file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project.\n|user|: ok, you don't get it. this a part of clpud service? any additional charge?"

You can learn how the actual cost of your app is calculated in this example.\n\nThe web app uses the following IBM Cloud services and items:\n\n\n\n* Four 256-MB Node.js runtime instances\n* Two Auto-Scaling policies, processor and memory\n* 150 GB per month IBM Cloudant database, 1,000 lookups, 500 writes, and 50 queries\n* 20 GB inbound or outbound network traffic\n\n\n\n\n\n Prices for IBM Cloud resources \n\nTo keep the example simple, assume the prices in the following table don't fluctuate within or between a timeframe, for example, a month. All pricing in this example is in US currency.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Pricing for resources\n\n Service Features Price \n\n SDK for Node.js\u2122 Charges for runtime by GB-hours $0.07 USD/GB-hour \n Auto-Scaling Free service plan for the Auto-Scaling service Free \n IBM Cloudant Standard plan includes 20 GB of free data storage <br>Scale provisioned throughput capacity in increments of: <br>100 lookups per second <br>50 writes per second <br>5 queries per second $1.00 USD/GB of data storage <br>$0.25 USD/Lookup per second <br>$0.50 USD/Write per second <br>$5.00 USD/Query per second \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Calculating the app price \n\nThe price of the app can be calculated in the following way:\n\nFour 256-MB Node.js runtime instances\n: IBM Cloud charges for a runtime by GB-hours. The number of GB used per month is 4 x 256 = 1024 MB or 1 GB per month. Assume that there are 24 x 30 = 720 hours in a month, so the application is charged for 1 x 720 = 720 GB-hours.\n\nIBM Cloud offers a free tier of [Cloud Foundry application usage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts) that affects the overall cost for an application that's running, by reducing your costs.",
