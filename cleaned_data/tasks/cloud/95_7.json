  "gold_answer": "To secure your cluster in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can use built-in security features to protect various components such as the Kubernetes API server, etcd data store, worker node, network, storage, images, and deployments against malicious attacks. These features help ensure security compliance and data integrity. Additionally, you can leverage built-in logging and monitoring tools to detect malicious attacks and suspicious usage patterns. As for access policies, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service uses Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) to grant access to cluster resources through IAM platform access roles and Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) policies through IAM service access roles. The access policies that you assign users depend on what you want your users to be able to do. You can find more information about what roles authorize which types of actions on the User access reference page or in the following table's links. For steps to assign policies, see Granting users access to your cluster through IBM Cloud IAM.",
