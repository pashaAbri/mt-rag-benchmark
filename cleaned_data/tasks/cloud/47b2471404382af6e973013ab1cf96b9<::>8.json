Within an enterprise, you create a multitiered hierarchy of accounts, with billing and payments for all accounts managed at the enterprise level.\n\nWhen compared to using multiple stand-alone accounts, enterprises offer the following key benefits:\n\n\n\n* Centralized account management: View your entire enterprise hierarchy at a glance, without needing to switch accounts. You can add existing accounts or create new accounts directly within the enterprise.\n* Consolidated subscription billing: Track your subscriptions and credit spending for all accounts from a single view. Your subscription credit is pooled and shared among accounts in the enterprise.\n* Top-down usage reporting: From your enterprise account, you can view usage of all accounts in your enterprise, which is organized by account group.\n\n\n\n\n\n Watch and learn \n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nYour IBM Cloud account is your home for collaboration in the cloud. As you scale up your workloads, you might find that you're managing multiple IBM Cloud accounts. For example, your company might have many teams, each with one or more of their own accounts for development, testing, and production environments. Or, you might isolate certain workloads in separate accounts to meet security or compliance guidelines. As the number of accounts grows, it can become more difficult to track resource usage and associated costs.\n\nIBM Cloud enterprises offer a simpler way to centrally manage billing and usage across multiple accounts. Within an enterprise, you can create a multi-tiered hierarchy of accounts by adding new or existing accounts and nesting them in account groups. How you structure your enterprise is up to you. For example, for a large organization, you might organize your accounts by geography, or by department. You can choose the structure that best fits how you want to track your usage. If your teams change, no problem - you can move accounts within the enterprise as needed.\n\nConsolidated billing simplifies invoicing and payment within your enterprise. Usage costs are deducted from a subscription credit pool that's shared between all accounts, so you can add and manage subscription credit from a single place.",

This tutorial is provided as an example of the steps you can follow to set up an enterprise by department, but you should carefully plan your enterprise structure around your organization's needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Create the enterprise \n\nEnterprises are created from an existing Subscription account. When you create the enterprise, the account is added to the enterprise hierarchy. Billing transitions to being managed by the enterprise, but its users and resources remain the same and are completely unaffected. For a complete description of account impacts, see [Creating an enterprise](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secure-enterprise?topic=secure-enterprise-create-enterprise).\n\n\n\n1. In the IBM Cloud\u00ae console, go to Manage > Enterprise, and click Create.\n2. Enter the name of your company, such as Example Corp, to identify your enterprise.\n3. Enter your company's domain, such as examplecorp.com.\n4. Review the information about the impact to your account, and select I understand the impact to my account. Then, click Create. The account is now permanently part of the enterprise and can't be removed.\n\n\n\nAfter your enterprise is created, you are directed to the enterprise dashboard. From here, you can view the enterprise details, accounts, users, and billing information. Go to the Accounts page to view your enterprise structure, where you see the following accounts:\n\n\n\n* An enterprise account with the same name as your enterprise. This account is used for enterprise management.\n* The account that you created the enterprise from. Users can continue working with resources in the account unaffected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2: Create an enterprise structure with account groups \n\nUse account groups to [organize related accounts](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-enterprise-organize). The second and third tier of the Example Corp. enterprise hierarchy contain the Marketing, Development, Sales, Design, and Engineering account groups. Complete the following steps to create the account groups:\n\n\n\n1.",
