  "gold_answer": "In case  the server expire, you indeed can remove  the entry from the resource list and also  wait for the target time to trigger deletion for you, or even manually trigger the deletion from the resource reclamations.If an expired server is restored, only the entry within the resource list is restored, not the server itself.Restoring servers that belong to paid plans\nServers that belong to a paid plans do not expire, and that's why they can be restored during the reclamation period. If a server is restored, the timeframe for which the server was within the resource reclamations is billed to your account. After the server is deleted, only metadata, which isn't considered to be personal data is kept for 6 months. Make sure you back up important data for future use because you can't recover data after the virtual server has been deleted.\n\n",
