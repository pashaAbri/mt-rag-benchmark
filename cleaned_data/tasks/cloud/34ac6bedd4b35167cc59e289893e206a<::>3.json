VMware Solutions and OpenShift\n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift overview \n\nThe Red Hat OpenShift platform is a platform that is designed to orchestrate containerized workloads across a cluster of nodes. The platform uses Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, which manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\n\nThe operating system of the nodes is Red Hat\u00ae Enterprise Linux\u00ae CoreOS, which is the container host version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and features an RHEL kernel with SELinux enabled by default. RHEL CoreOS includes kubelet, which is the Kubernetes node agent, and the CRI-O container runtime, which is optimized for Kubernetes. In Red Hat OpenShift 4.7, you must use RHEL CoreOS for all control plane machines, but you can use Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as the operating system for compute, or worker machines. If you choose to use RHEL workers, you must perform more system maintenance than if you use RHEL CoreOS for all of the cluster machines.\n\nThe reference architecture and this build process use RHEL CoreOS. The nodes must have direct Internet access to complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Access the Red Hat OpenShift Infrastructure Providers page to download the installation program.\n* Access quay.io to obtain the packages that are required to install the cluster.\n* Obtain the packages that are required to perform cluster updates.\n* Access Red Hat\u2019s software as a service page to perform subscription management.\n\n\n\nIn the reference architecture, the following components are installed and configured in the build process:\n\n\n\n* Bastion node - This RHEL VM acts as a \"jump-server\" on the overlay network to enable the build process. It is accessed by using SSH through the private network. It also hosts a webserver to help the build process of the cluster.",
