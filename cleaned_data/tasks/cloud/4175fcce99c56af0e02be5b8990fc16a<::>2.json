  "gold_answer": "Data Encryption Keys (DEKs) encrypt your data and can be created and managed by your service or an IBM Cloud service. In the context of IBM Cloud VPC, data encryption can be applied to block storage volumes using either IBM-managed encryption or customer-managed encryption. When restoring a volume from a backup snapshot, if the source volume used customer-managed encryption, the new volume will inherit that encryption with the original customer root key (CRK).",

Symmetric key algorithms work faster, are more scalable, and more secure than public key algorithms. Public key algorithms use complicated mathematics that increase computational overhead, especially when dealing with large volumes of data. Public key algorithms are also more susceptible to brute force attacks due to having a private key algorithm component that is easily recognizable by hackers. Symmetric key algorithms requires less computed power and are resistant to brute force attacks due to having a less recognizable structure.\n2. Public key algorithms allow for easier access control when granting access to keys at an individual level compared to symmetric key algorithms. Symmetric key algorithms have a key exchange problem, which is that access to a secret key can only be exchanged through a secure transfer. By using public key algorithms, encrypted DEKs (wDEKs) can be shared and unencrypted only by those with access to the encrypting root key, mitigating the key exchange problem of symmetric algorithms.\n\n\n\n* Easier key management You can encrypt multiple DEKs under a singular root key, which minimizes the amount of keys that you might need to manage in a key management service. You can also choose to save time on key maintenance by only rotating your root keys, instead of rotating and re-encrypting all of your DEKs. Note that in cases such as personnel turnover, process malfunctions, or the detection of a security issue, it is recommended to rotate all DEKs and root keys associated with the incident.\n* Data Key Protection Since your DEKs are wrapped by a root key, you do not have to worry about how to store the encrypted data key. Due to this, you can store the wDEK with alongside the associated encrypted data.\n\n\n\nKey Protect uses the Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm in Galois/Counter Mode (AES GCM) to wrap and unwrap DEKs. CRKs that are not imported are created with 256-bit key material.",
