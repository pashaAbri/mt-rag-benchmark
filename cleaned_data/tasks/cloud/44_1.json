Red Hat\u00ae OpenShift\u00ae is enterprise Kubernetes platform enabling IT organizations to develop applications faster, deploy them reliably, and manage them efficiently.\n\nIn addition to developing new cloud-native applications, IT organizations are modernizing older, monolithic core business applications to support the faster delivery of new function to the business.\n\nFor information on application modernization on Power Systems, see [Field Guide to Application Modernization on IBM Power Systems](https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/D9POQ3YR).\n\nFor information on deploying Red Hat OpenShift on Power Systems Virtual Server and tutorials to explore the platform, see [Deploying Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.x on IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://developer.ibm.com/series/deploy-ocp-cloud-paks-power-virtual-server/?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=%20Deploying%20Red%20Hat%20OpenShift%20Container%20Platform%20on%20Power%20Virtual%20Servers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
