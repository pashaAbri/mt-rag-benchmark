  "gold_answer": "Virtual Servers for VPC is an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) offering that provides the benefits of VPC, including network isolation, security, and flexibility. This flexibility allows you to customize the system according to your specific needs, giving you control over your infrastructure.\nWith Virtual Servers for VPC, you can quickly provision instances with high network performance. When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and computing power needed for the application you plan to run. Instances are available on the x86 architecture.\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) allows you to establish your virtual private cloud by defining a virtual network that is logically isolated from all other public cloud tenants. The software-defined networking (SDN) and virtual network functions allow you to quickly establish the network constructs and on-prem connectivity needed to run your workload.\nHyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC takes advantage of IBM Secure Execution for Linux to provide a boundary around each instance, offering protection from internal and external threats. It provides the following benefits:\n- Secure Execution boundary for protection from internal and external threats\n- Technical assurance that unauthorized users, including IBM Cloud admins, do not have access to the application\n- Individual, instance-level secure boundaries lock down workloads\n- Multiparty contract and attestation of deployment\n- Zero Trust principles from workload development through deployment.",

When you provision an instance, you select a profile that matches the amount of memory and compute power that you need for the application that you plan to run on the instance. Instances are available on the x86 architecture.\n\n\n\n\n\n Dedicated hosts for VPC (optional) \n\nWith [Dedicated hosts for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-dedicated-hosts-instances), you can carve out a single-tenant compute node, free from users outside of your organization. Within that dedicated space, you can create virtual server instances according to your needs. Additionally, you can create dedicated host groups that contain dedicated hosts for a specific purpose. Because a dedicated host is a single-tenant space, only users within your account that have the required permissions can create instances on the host.\n\nDedicated hosts are highly recommended when you use virtual servers, particularly for any parts of your application that process regulated data and keep it in memory.\n\n\n\n\n\n IBM Cloud Auto Scale for VPC (optional) \n\n[Auto Scale for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-auto-scale-instance-group) is highly recommended if you are using virtual servers. With Auto Scale for VPC, you can improve performance and costs by dynamically creating virtual server instances to meet the demands of your environment. You set scaling policies that define your desired average utilization for metrics like CPU, memory, and network usage. The policies that you define determine when virtual server instances are added or removed from your instance group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Containers \n\n\n\n Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud \n\nIn addition to Virtual Servers for VPC, you can use [Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-roks-overview) if you want to run containers. {{site.data.content.openshift-service-description}}",

Please note that while your circumstance may not be exactly identical, you will still benefit from the overall journey steps and concepts covered in this guide.\n\n\n\n* You are already familar with the concepts introduced in the \"Tour IBM Cloud\" videos available on the [Getting Started with IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/cloud/get-started) page.\n* Access groups will need to be defined so only certain users have the ability to create and manage the VPC network settings (i.e. CIDR ranges, Subnet ACL rules, etc.,).\n* You have a networking background and familar with concepts such as IP Addressing, subnets, routing, etc.,\n* Focus will be on establishing the underlying network connectivity to support VPC based workloads.\n\n\n\n* Note: A separate deployment guide will cover the compute resources which runs within the VPC like IBM Kubernetes Services (IKS), Red Hat OpenShift, IBM Code Engine, and VPC Virtual Server Instances (VSIs).",

Use the following information to understand a simple use case for planning, creating, and configuring resources for your VPC, and learn about more VPC overviews and VPC tutorials. For more information about VPC, see [Getting started with Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-getting-started).\n\n\n\n\n\n SAP products architecture on IBM Cloud VPC \n\nA [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/vpc?mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=VPC) contains one of the most secure and reliable cloud environments for SAP applications within your own VPC with its included virtual server instances. This represents an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) within IBM Cloud that offers all of the benefits of isolated, secure, and flexible virtual cloud infrastructure from IBM. In comparison, the IBM Cloud classic infrastructure virtual servers offering uses virtual instances with native and VLAN networking to communicate to each other within a data center; however, the instances are restricted in one well-working pod by using subnet and VLAN networking as a gap scale up of virtual resources should rely between the pods. What\u2019s new with IBM Cloud VPC is a network orchestrator layer concept that eliminates the pod boundaries and restrictions, so this new concept handles all the networking for every virtual instance running within VPC across regions and zones.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1. Highly available system for SAP NetWeaver on IBM Cloud VPC \n\nIn a highly available (HA) system, every instance can run on a separate IBM Cloud virtual server instance. The cluster HA configuration for the SAP application server consists of two virtual server instances, each of them located in the same zone within the region by using placement groups. Placement groups assure that both cluster resources and cloud resources are also located in different compute nodes as specified in the following placement groups section.\n\nZoom\n\n![Figure 1.",
