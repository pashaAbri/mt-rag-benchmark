From your IBM Cloud resource list, select your provisioned instance of Key Protect.\n4. On the application details page, use the Keys table to browse the keys in your service.\n5. Click the \u22ef icon to open a list of options for the key that you want to delete.\nPlease note that when you delete a key, it is \"soft deleted\", meaning that the key and its associated data will be restorable up to 30 days after deletion. After 90 days, the key becomes eligible to be automatically purged, or hard deleted, and its associated data will be permanently removed from the Key Protect service.\nAlso, keep in mind that deleting a key will make any data encrypted by the key inaccessible. If the key is restored within the 30-day time frame, this can be reversed. However, after 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged. Once a key is no longer restorable and has been purged, its associated data can no longer be accessed.",

      "text": "\nAbout deleting and purging keys \n\nYou can use IBM\u00ae Key Protect for IBM Cloud\u00ae to delete an encryption key and its key material if you are a manager for your Key Protect instance.\n\nBefore you can delete an instance, you must delete every key in that instance. However, if you close your account, any existing instances and keys are automatically hard deleted. Check out [Account cancelation and data deletion](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-complianceaccount-cancelation) for more information.\n\nIn the event that a key is no longer needed or should be removed, Key Protect allows you to delete and ultimately purge keys, an action that shreds the key material and makes any of the data encrypted with it inaccessible.\n\nDeleting a key moves it into a Destroyed state, a \"soft\" deletion in which the key can still be seen and restored for 30 days. After 90 days, the key will be automatically purged, or \"hard deleted\", and its associated data will be permanently shredded and removed from the Key Protect service. If it is desirable that a key be purged sooner than 90 days, it is also possible to hard delete a key four hours after it has been moved into the Destroyed state.\n\nAfter a key has been deleted, any data that is encrypted by the key becomes inaccessible, though this can be reversed if the key is restored within the 30-day time frame. After 30 days, key metadata, registrations, and policies are available for up to 90 days, at which point the key becomes eligible to be purged. Note that once a key is no longer restorable and has been purged, its associated data can no longer be accessed. As a result, [destroying resources](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-security-and-compliancedata-deletion) is not recommended for production environments unless absolutely necessary.\n\nThe following table lists the time frames in which you can view, restore, and purge a key after it has been deleted.\n\n\n\nTable 1.
