The web chat integration can help your customers with common questions and tasks; it can understand customer messages in any of the languages that are supported by the service, and it engages your users when they need help, answering their questions quickly and efficiently, and providing fallback options so there is always a path to a solution. It is also customizable, secure, and supports a wide range of desktop and mobile browsers. Building a custom user interface for these functionalities would require significant time and effort, which could be better spent on building a high-quality assistant. Additionally, the web chat widget is easy for you to deploy and easy for customers to use.\n|user|: how to add web chat widget?"
