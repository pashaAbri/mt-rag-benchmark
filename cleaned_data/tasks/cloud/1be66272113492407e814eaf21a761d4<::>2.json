For instance, you can set an alert to trigger when CPU usage exceeds 80% for at least 5 minutes. - Notification Channel: Enable 1 or more notification channels to receive alert notifications. Remember to save your alert settings after configuring them.

When an alert is triggered, you can be notified through 1 or more notification channels. An alert definition can generate multi-channel notifications.\n\nAn alert is a notification event that you can use to warn about situations that require attention. Each alert has a severity status. This status informs you about the criticality of the information it reports on.\n\nWhen you define an alert, you must define the condition that triggers the notification, and one or more notification channels through which you want to be notified. You must also define the severity of the alert, and the type of alert. For more information about how to configure an alert, see [Configuring an alert](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-alert-config).\n\nBy default, severity is set to warning. You can set the severity of an alert to any of the following values: emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, informational, debug*\n\nYou can define an alert on a single metric or a set of metrics to notify of events or issues that you want to monitor.\n\n\n\n* You can define a single condition alert.\n* You can define a multi-condition alert. The alert threshold is configured by using complex conditions.\n* You can define how the data is aggregated.\n* You can use boolean logic to define alerts that report on multiple metrics.\n* You get a notification when the alert condition is met.\n* You can configure multiple notification channels per alert.\n* Alerts are executed in 1 minute or less from receipt, with the option to configure the trigger wait time by hour or day.\n* For PromQL alerts only, you can optionally configure a 0 minute wait time.\n\n\n\nYou can enable predefined alerts, modify alerts, and create custom alerts in the web UI and by using the IBM Cloud Monitoring API.\n\nYou manage alerts in the Alerts view of the web UI.",

Data is not ready until the initial indexing of a new metric source is completed. Therefore, new sources such as clusters, platform metrics, or systems that you configure, all take some time to become visible through the Monitoring UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n Sending notifications \n\nYou can configure single alerts and multi-condition alerts to notify about problems that may require attention.
