  "gold_answer": "To update the cluster master, you should follow these steps:\n1. Check if your cluster is unsupported by reviewing the State field in the output of the `ibmcloud ks cluster ls` command or in the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service console.\n2. If your cluster is unsupported, you need to create a new cluster and deploy your apps to the new cluster. Then, you can delete the unsupported cluster.\n3. Before updating to the latest version, make sure to update deprecated clusters to a supported version that is one or two behind the current version. For example, you can update to version 1.21 or 1.22 before updating to the latest version, 1.23.\n4. If the worker nodes run a version two or more behind the master, update them to the same version as the master to avoid issues with your pods.\n5. Finally, update the cluster using the instructions provided in the IBM Cloud documentation: <https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-updateupdate>.\nKeep in mind that updating a cluster to a new version may impact deployed apps, so it's essential to prepare accordingly.",
