Understanding how these components are linked and how access functions will help you set up your account effectively. An IBM Cloud account is necessary for provisioning and managing IBM Cloud services that are part of the IBM Cloud for Financial Services reference architectures. In addition to outlining the high-level steps to follow, we will also describe some best practices for setting up your account that will assist you in meeting the requirements of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services. We will also provide the most relevant control requirements.",

      "text": "\nWhat's in an account? \n\nYour IBM Cloud\u00ae account includes many interacting components and systems for resource, user, and access management. Concepts like how certain components are connected or how access works help you in understanding how to set up your account.\n\nThe following diagram contains two main concepts for the components in the account hierarchy that are important to understand. The use of the solid lines and the dotted lines help illustrate that some components are contained within others, for example, users are added to access groups. However, some components interact with others for providing access instead of membership. For example, users are given access to resource groups but are not members of a resource group the same way they are for access groups.\n\nZoom\n\n![A diagram that shows the components in an account, including services, users, and the subcomponents of each.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/4d8c6eec891cff72b666dc24bd3211810c77fb42/account/images/account_diagram.svg)\n\nFigure 1. A diagram that shows the components in an account, including services, users, and the subcomponents of each.\n\nUsers\n: Users are invited to the account and given access to the resources in the account.\n\nService IDs\n: A service ID identifies a service or application similar to how a user ID identifies a user. You can use a service ID that you create to enable an application outside of IBM Cloud access to your services. You can assign specific access policies to the service ID that restrict permissions for using specific services, or even combine permissions for accessing different services. Since service IDs are not tied to a specific user, if a user happens to leave an organization and is deleted from the account, the service ID remains, ensuring that your application or service stays up and running. For more information, see [Creating and working with service IDs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-serviceids).\n\nTrusted profiles",

Along with the high-level steps to follow, we describe some of the best practices for account setup that will help you satisfy the requirements of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services. In addition, the most relevant [control requirements](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-aboutframework-control-requirements) are provided.\n\n\n\n1. Create an IBM Cloud account. For more information, see [Create your account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-startedaccount-gs-create).\n\nIt is highly recommended that you use a functional ID that is owned by your company rather than an employee's personal ID. A functional ID is a company-owned email address (such as ibm-cloud-admin@domain.com) used to represent a functional user. This allows for uninterrupted administrative access by the account owner as employees leave the company or are reassigned to other projects.\n\nThe following table shows the controls that are most related to this step.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Related controls in IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services for account creation\n\n Family Control \n\n Access Control (AC) [AC-2 Account Management](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services-controls?topic=framework-financial-services-controls-ac-2) \n\n\n\n2. Set up the Activity Tracker Event Routing service as described in [Audit logging for IBM Cloud events](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/framework-financial-services?topic=framework-financial-services-shared-logging-audit). This enables IBM Cloud platform events to be recorded for auditing purposes. Setting this up early in the process is important so that all platform events that occur during the rest of these steps are available in the audit logs.\n\nThe following table shows the controls that are most related to this step.\n\n\n\nTable 2.",
