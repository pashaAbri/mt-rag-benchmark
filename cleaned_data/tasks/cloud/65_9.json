The search skill works with IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery service to extract information from a designated data collection. By creating a search skill, you'll receive a free instance of Discovery. After setting up the search, you can test it by sending queries and preview the results in the search skill's Preview pane.",

Each time you add or change the training data, the training process is triggered to ensure that the underlying model stays up-to-date as your customer needs and the topics they want to discuss change.\n\n\n\n\n\n Search skill ![Plus or higher plans only](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/plus.png) \n\nWhen Watson Assistant doesn't have an explicit solution to a problem, it routes the user question to a search skill to find an answer from across your disparate sources of self-service content. The search skill interacts with the IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery service to extract this information from a configured data collection.\n\nIf you already use the Discovery service, you can mine your existing data collections for source material that you can share with customers to address their questions.\n\nHowever, you do not need to have a Discovery service instance. If you choose to create a search skill, a free instance of Discovery is provisioned for you. You can then create a collection from a data source and configure your search skill to search this collection for answers to customer queries.\n\nThe following diagram illustrates how user input is processed when both a dialog skill and a search skill are added to an assistant. Any questions that the dialog is not designed to answer are sent to the search skill, which finds a relevant response from a Discovery data collection.\n\n![Diagram of how a question gets routed to the search skill.]",
