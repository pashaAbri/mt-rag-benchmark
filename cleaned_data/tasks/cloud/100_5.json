A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Secret types in Secrets Manager\n\n Type Programmatic name Kind Description \n\n [Arbitrary secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-arbitrary-secrets) arbitrary Static Arbitrary pieces of sensitive data, including any type of structured or unstructured data, that you can use to access an application or resource. \n [IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials) iam_credentials* Dynamic A dynamically generated service ID and API key that can be used to access an IBM Cloud service that requires IAM authentication. \n [Key-value secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-key-value) kv Static Pieces of sensitive data that is structured in JSON format that you can use to access an application or resource.",

Dynamic secrets have their expiration date and time enforced when their secret data is read or accessed, while static secrets have their expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time.

Secrets that you create in Secrets Manager can be static or dynamic in nature. A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a dynamic secret has its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.

The key difference lies in when this enforcement occurs. For static secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, for dynamic secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced when the secret data is read or accessed. When trying to rotate a secret, the request's success depends on whether the previous version is locked or not. Automatic rotation is available only for secrets that are generated by Secrets Manager.
