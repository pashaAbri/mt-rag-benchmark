It should be at least 12 characters long and not contain common phrases or easily guessable information like your name or birthdate.

By defining advanced policies, you can define the rules that a user must conform to when they set their password or attempt to sign in to your app. For example, you can set the number of times that a user can try to sign in before they are locked out of their account.\n\n\n\n Policy: password strength \n\nA strong password makes it difficult, or even improbable for someone to guess the password in either a manual or automated way. To set requirements for the strength of a user's password, you can use the following steps.\n\nTo set this configuration by using the GUI:\n\n\n\n1. Go to the Cloud Directory > Password policies tab of the App ID dashboard.\n2. In the Define password strength box, click Edit. A screen opens.\n3. Enter a valid regex string in the Password strength box.\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n* Must be at least 8 characters. (^.{8,}$)\n* Must have one number, one lowercase letter, and one capital letter. (^(?:(?=.d)(?=.[a-z])(?=.[A-Z]).)$)\n* Must have only English letters and numbers. (^[A-Za-z0-9]$)\n* Must have at least one unique character. (^(w)w?(?!1)w+$)\n\n\n\n4.
