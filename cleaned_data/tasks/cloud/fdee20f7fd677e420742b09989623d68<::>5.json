By editing the configuration object, you can customize the appearance and behavior of the web chat before it is rendered.\n* Runtime methods: Use the instance methods to perform tasks before a conversation between the assistant and your customer begins or after it ends.\n* Events: Your website can listen for these events, and then take custom actions.\n\n\n\nA developer can use these APIs to customize the web chat in the following ways:\n\n\n\n* [Change how the web chat opens and closes](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-configweb-chat-config-open-close)\n* [Change the conversation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-configweb-chat-config-convo)\n* [Change the look of the web chat](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-web-chat-configweb-chat-config-look)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Change how the web chat opens and closes \n\nYou can change the color of the launcher icon from the Style tab of the web chat configuration page.

For examples of how to complete common tasks, see [Passing values](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-configweb-chat-config-context).\n* Change the language that is used by the web chat. For more information, see [Global audience support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-web-chat-basicsweb-chat-basics-global).\n* Render your own custom response types inside the web chat widget, including responses that incorporate code from your website at run time. For a tutorial that shows you how, see [Creating a custom response](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=tutorials-user-defined-response).\n* Use React portals to render your custom response type as part of your application.
