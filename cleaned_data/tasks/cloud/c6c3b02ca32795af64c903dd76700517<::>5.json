  "gold_answer": "Vulnerability Advisor version 4 uses new architecture and a different scanning engine compared to version 3. In version 4, the image is indexed the first time it is pushed and the vulnerability assessment is calculated every time Vulnerability Advisor is queried about that image. In contrast, version 3 triggers the scanning of an image when a new image is pushed to the registry, when a new security notice is released for a package that is installed in the image, or while an image is tagged in the registry. Additionally, version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023 and it is recommended to update to version 4.",

Vulnerability Advisor checks the security status of container images that are provided by IBM, third parties, or added to your organization's registry namespace.\n\nVulnerability Advisor provides security management for [IBM Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-getting-startedgetting-started). Vulnerability Advisor generates a security status report that includes suggested fixes and best practices. Vulnerability Advisor is available in two versions: version 3 and version 4. Version 4 uses new architecture and a different scanning engine.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023. For more information about how to update to version 4, see [Update Vulnerability Advisor to version 4 by 19 June 2023](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Registry?topic=Registry-registry_notices_va_v4&interface=ui).\n\nWhen you add an image to a namespace, the image is automatically scanned by Vulnerability Advisor to detect security issues and potential vulnerabilities. If security issues are found, instructions are provided to help fix the reported vulnerability.\n\nAny issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor result in a verdict that indicates that it is not advisable to deploy this image. If you choose to deploy the image, any containers that are deployed from the image include known issues that might be used to attack or otherwise compromise the container. The verdict is adjusted based on any exemptions that you specified.\n\nFixing the security and configuration issues that are reported by Vulnerability Advisor can help you to secure your IBM Cloud infrastructure.\n\nYou can use IBM Cloud Security and Compliance Center to monitor vulnerabilities that are detected by Vulnerability Advisor. For more information, see [Getting started with Security and Compliance Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/security-compliance?topic=security-compliance-getting-started).\n\nUsing Portieris to block the deployment of images with issues that are found by Vulnerability Advisor is deprecated.\n\n\n\n About Vulnerability Advisor \n\nVulnerability Advisor provides functions to help you to secure your images.\n\nVulnerability Advisor version 3 is deprecated from 19 June 2023.",
