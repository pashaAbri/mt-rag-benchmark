In the phone integration settings, go to the Phone number tab.\n2. Use one of the following methods:\n\n\n\n* To add phone numbers one by one, click Add phone number in the table, and enter the phone number along with an optional description. Click the Add button to save the number.\n* To import a set of phone numbers that are stored in a comma-separated values (CSV) file, click the Upload a CSV file icon (![Add phone number][images/phone-integ-import-number.png]), and then find the CSV file that contains the list of phone numbers.\n\nThe phone numbers you upload will replace any existing numbers in the table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Setting up live agent escalation \n\nIf you want your assistant to be able to transfer a conversation to a live agent, you can connect your phone integration to a contact center. For more information, see instructions for the supported platform:\n\n\n\n* [Genesys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-genesys)\n* [Twilio Flex](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-flex)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Phone integration limits \n\nAny speech service charges incurred by the phone integration are included as Voice add-on charges in your Watson Assistant service plan usage. The Voice add-on use is charged separately and in addition to your service plan charges.\n\nPlan usage is measured based on the number of monthly active users, where a user is identified by the caller's unique phone number. An MD5 hash is applied to the phone number and the 128-bit hash value is used for billing purposes.\n\nThe number of concurrent calls that your assistant can participate in at one time depends on your plan type.\n\n\n\nPlan details\n\n Plan Concurrent calls \n\n Enterprise 1,000",
