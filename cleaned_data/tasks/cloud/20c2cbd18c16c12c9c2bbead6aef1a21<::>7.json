A small amount of JavaScript is injected into client devices using [Google\u2019s Picasso fingerprinting technique](https://research.google/pubs/pub45581/). Picasso results are factored into bot scores and help CIS classify traffic as automated or human. BotScoreSrc: Not Computed and a score of 0 are relevant to Picasso JavaScript Fingerprinting requests. These requests are exempt from being blocked by any firewall rules.\n\nThis detection technique gathers general data about the machines reaching CIS. For example, if a particular user is accessing CIS via Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, because there are millions of people using Google Chrome on a MacBook Pro, CIS cannot identify specific individuals. CIS also takes steps to anonymize and phase out data for added privacy.\n\nJavaScript is only injected in response to requests for HTML pages or page views, excluding AJAX calls. API and mobile app traffic is unaffected. Additionally, code is not injected again until its 30-minute session life expires. The Picasso script is roughly 70 KB and execution time varies by device, anywhere from 90 ms to around 500 ms.\n\nThe snippets of JavaScript will contain a source pointing to the challenge platform with paths that start with /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/....\n\n\n\n Enable JavaScript detections \n\nFor no-cost Trial plans (Bot Fight Mode), JavaScript detections are automatically enabled and cannot be disabled.\n\nFor all other plans (Super Bot Fight Mode and Bot Management for Enterprise), JavaScript detections are optional. To adjust your settings, go to Security > Bots.\n\n\n\n\n\n Enforcing execution of JavaScript detections \n\nTo ensure that visitors have previously run and passed JavaScript detections, you can create a firewall rule with the field cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed which performs a Managed Challenge action. Enter (cf.bot_management.js_detection.passed) into the Expression preview section as a singular rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n Considerations \n\n\n\n* If you have a Content Security Policy (CSP):\n\n\n\n* Ensure that anything under /cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/ is allowed.",

You can toggle the button off within 24 hours to revert to the previous version. To make changes after 24 hours, contact support.  Indeed it is very important to update the machine because not updating to the latest version, you will be using a machine learning model that is no longer maintained or monitored by the engineering team. As internet traffic changes and new trends evolve, the scoring accuracy of older versions can degrade.\n|user|: Can I create a machine learning model and how should I do that?\n|assistant|: I can give you information about how create a machine learning model in Knowledge Studio. It involves training the machine learning model and evaluating how well the model performed when annotating test data and blind data.    By exploring the performance metrics, you can identify ways to improve the model's accuracy.  Restriction: Only three machine learning models can be trained at a time per Knowledge Studio instance. If your instance contains multiple workspaces and the number of machine learning models that are being trained in other workspaces totals 3 already, then your request to train the machine learning model in your workspace will be queued until the other training processes are done.  It is important to note that . Only documents that became ground truth through approval or adjudication can be used to train the machine learning model. Always have in mind  to create a machine learning model that trains a model you can use to identify entities, coreferences, and relationships of interest in new documents.Knowledge Studio provides a rules editor that simplifies the process of finding and capturing common patterns in your documents as rules.

A bot manager can also distinguish between good and bad bots by using further behavioral analysis.\n\nAnother bot management approach is to use the robots.txt file to set up a honeypot. A honeypot is a fake target for bad actors that, when accessed, exposes the bad actor as malicious. In the case of a bot, a honeypot could be a webpage on the site that's forbidden to bots by the robots.txt file.

For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.\n\nBy using secrets, you're able to authenticate to protected resources as you build your applications. For example, when you try to access an external service API, you're asked to provide a unique credential. After you supply your credential, the external service can understand who you are and whether you're authorized to interact with it.\n\nTo learn more about the general characteristics of a secret, check out the following video.\n\n\n\n* Video transcript\n\nHow are you making sure that your secrets are securely stored so that you can avoid data breaches and chaos in your DevOps workflows?\n\nHi, I'm Alex Greer with the IBM Cloud team, and before I get started make sure to like and subscribe now.\n\nWhat is a secret?\n\nA secret is a digital credential that is going to allow entities to communicate and perform actions on a service. This discrete piece of information keeps that access point secure. So let's look at how this paradigm exists.\n\nLet's start with an entity here that needs to access some sort of service. We'll leave it little ambiguous for now, but some sort of service. To properly communicate with the service and be able to take the action that it needs to get its job done, this entity is going to need to communicate to the service two things: One, who it is, so that service can understand what or who is interacting with it. Two, it's going to have to know the set of permissions that it should grant in the context of its service. With these, the service can now properly allow that entity to interact with them. How we enable this interaction is with something we call a \"secret.\"\n\nNow, with this dynamic established, let's move into an example with users. For users, we'll say that this user here is our entity, and we'll say our service here \u2013 let's say that it's a developer, and they happen to need read or write access. They're interacting with the development repo to do that.",

Service design should minimize the number of machines and people with access to secrets by using both authorization and network restrictions based on the principle of least privilege.\n* Secrets are rotated in according with the requirements of the IBM Cloud Framework for Financial Services with minimal or no downtime.\n* Secrets are never stored in source code, configuration files, or documentation.\n\n\n\nThe following table lists the different solutions that you can use to protect your application secrets.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Secrets management and data protection scenarios\n\n Scenario What to use \n\n You need to create, lease, and manage API keys, credentials, database configurations, and other secrets for your services and applications. Use [IBM Cloud Secrets Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-getting-started). \n You need to generate, renew, and manage TLS/SSL certificates for your deployments. Use [IBM Cloud Secrets Manager](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-getting-started). \n You need to create and manage encryption keys. Use [Hyper Protect Crypto Services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/hs-crypto?topic=hs-crypto-overview) to manage encryption keys in a single-tenant service with dedicated hardware.",
