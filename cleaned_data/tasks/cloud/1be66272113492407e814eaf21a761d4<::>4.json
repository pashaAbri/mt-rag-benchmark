When you set up monitoring, you can define [alerts](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/alerts.html) that notify you when an event or an issue occurs that requires your attention. You can send alerts over a variety of [supported notification channels](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-notifications), including IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions actions. For more information, see [Sending SMS alerts using Cloud Functions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-cf_sms).\n\nIAM-secured Cloud Functions actions, as well as web actions can be used by the notification channel. For more information about setting up the Cloud Functions notification channel, see [Configure IBM Cloud Function Channel](https://docs.sysdig.com/en/configure-ibm-cloud-functions-channel.html).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from the Department of Homeland Security can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless.",

To enable this 500 error response capability for a specific Watson Assistant instance, you need to make a request to IBM.\n\nYou should plan for both full and partial service outages. A good first step is to plan for a manual failover between regions before enabling automation. This requires a complete replica of Watson Assistant in both regions, including all custom speech model training. When automation is enabled it is best to start with a strategy for detecting and failing over to the passive backup region when a complete regional outage is detected. After this is in place, a strategy can be implemented to deal with partial outages, which should cover the vast majority of failure conditions that can occur with a phone integration deployment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Web chat \n\n\n\n Monitoring \n\nWeb chat provides an onError listening feature that allows the host page to detect specific types of outage errors, in particular INITIAL_CONFIG, OPEN_CONFIG, and MESSAGE_COMMUNICATION errors.\n\nYou can find the documentation for this feature here:\n\n[https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configuration#onerror-detail](https://web-chat.global.assistant.watson.cloud.ibm.com/docs.html?to=api-configurationonerror-detail)\n\n\n\n\n\n Failover \n\nHandling a failover for web chat is simple assuming you have set up an additional web chat integration in another region. When the failover needs to be manually triggered, make the following changes:\n\n\n\n* The embed script that contains your integration ID, region, service instance ID, and subscription ID (if applicable) needs be changed or updated to use the IDs for the new integration and region.\n* If you are using Salesforce or ZenDesk integrations for connecting to human agents, update the configuration within those systems to make sure they can communicate with the correct integration. Follow the instructions on the Live agent tab in the web chat configuration for setting up those systems. This is only needed for obtaining the conversation history for the agent.",

The provided document mentions a feature called \"web chat\" that has an \"onError listening feature\" to detect specific types of outage errors. This suggests that there is some level of monitoring in place for web chat conversations. However, the document does not provide detailed information about the extent or nature of this monitoring. For more specific information, it would be necessary to refer to the documentation or contact IBM.\nRegarding the monitoring of metrics, the document explains how to compare metrics for different periods using the Time period control and how to configure alerts based on specific metric conditions. This implies that various metrics related to the performance, availability, and usage of resources in the cloud environment are being monitored."
