      "text": "\nKeep in mind that some services such as Ingress might require multiple worker nodes for high availability, and you might not be able to run these services or your apps in the smallest size cluster possible.\n* Which Kubernetes versions does the service support?\n\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service concurrently supports multiple versions of Kubernetes. When a new version (n) is released, versions up to 2 behind (n-2) are supported. Versions more than 2 behind the latest (n-3) are first deprecated and then unsupported.\n\nFor more information about supported versions and update actions that you must take to move from one version to another, see [Kubernetes version information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions)\n* Which worker node operating systems does the service support?\n\nFor a list of supported worker node operated systems by cluster version, see [Kubernetes version information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).\n* Where is the service available?\n\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is available worldwide. You can create clusters in every supported IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service region.\n\nFor more information about supported regions, see [Locations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zonesregions-and-zones).\n* Is the service highly available?\n\nYes. By default, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service sets up many components such as the cluster master with replicas, anti-affinity, and other options to increase the high availability (HA) of the service. You can increase the redundancy and failure toleration of your cluster worker nodes, storage, networking, and workloads by configuring them in a highly available architecture. For an overview of the default setup and your options to increase HA, see [High availability for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha).",
