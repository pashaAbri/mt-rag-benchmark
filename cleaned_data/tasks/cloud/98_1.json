For more information, see the Discovery [API reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/discovery-dataquery). For an overview of query concepts, see the [Query overview](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-concepts).\n\nQueries that are written in the Discovery Query Language can include both search and structure parameters.\n\nThe default values for query parameters can differ by project type. For more information about default values, see [Default query settings](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-defaults).\n\n\n\n Search parameters \n\nUse search parameters to search your collection, identify a result set, and analyze the result set.\n\nThe results set is the group of documents that are identified by the combined searches of the search parameters. The results set might be significantly larger than the returned results. If an empty query is submitted, the results set is equal to all the documents in the collection.\n\nDocuments that you do not have permissions to access are not returned in query results.\n\n\n\n\n\n Answer finding \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nThe find_answers parameter is supported in managed deployments only.\n\nBy default, Discovery provides answers by returning the entire [passage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery-data?topic=discovery-data-query-parameterspassages) that contains the answer to a natural language query. When the answer-finding feature is enabled, Discovery also provides a \"short answer\" within the passage, and a confidence score to show whether the \"short answer\" answers the question that is explicit or implicit in the user query. Applications that use the answer-finding feature can display the short answer alone or can display the short answer emphasized in the context of the full passage. For most applications, displaying the short answer emphasized within the full passage is preferable, because answers generally make more sense in context.\n\nThe answer finding feature behaves in the following ways:\n\nIn the passage examples that follow, the short answers are shown in bold font.\n\n\n\n* Finds answers.",

However, there is a difference between the two parameters.\n\n\n\n* Using a filter parameter alone returns search results in no specific order.\n* Using a query parameter alone returns search results in order of relevance.\n\n\n\nIn large data sets, if you need results returned in order of relevance, it is advisable that you combine the filter and query parameters because using them together improves performance. The reason is because the filter parameter runs first and caches results, and then the query parameter ranks them. For an example of using filters and queries together, see [Building combined queries](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-conceptsbuilding-combined-queries). Filters can also be used in aggregations.\n\nWhen you write a query that includes both a filter, and an aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameter; the filter parameters run first, after which any aggregation, query, or natural_language_query parameters run in parallel.\n\nWith a simple query, especially on a small data set, filter and query often return the exact same (or similar) results. If a filter and query call return similar results, and getting a response in order of relevance does not matter, it is better to use filter because filter calls are faster and are cached. Caching means that the next time you make that call, you get a much quicker response, particularly in a big data set.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n aggregation \n\nAggregation queries return a count of documents matching a set of data values; for example, top keywords, overall sentiment of entities, and more. For the full list of aggregation options, see the [Aggregations table](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/discovery?topic=discovery-query-aggregations).
