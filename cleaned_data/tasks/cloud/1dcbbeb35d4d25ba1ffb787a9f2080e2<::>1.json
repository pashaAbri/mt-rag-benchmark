A unique user can have multiple conversations, but a conversation never has more than one unique user.\n\nConversation is a set of messages consisting of the messages that an individual user sends to your assistant, and the messages your assistant sends back. Conversations can have multiple requests within a single conversation, but a single request doesn't span more than 1 conversation.\n\nRequest is a root-level utterance, such as an initial question or request, that signals the start of a specific flow. A user can initiate multiple requests. Requests are meant to represent the core concepts or topics your users are asking about. A request can have multiple steps within it, for example I want to order a pizza is a request. Delivery/takeout, Small/Medium/Large, Cheese/Pepperoni/Mushrooms/Peppers are all steps within the request of ordering a pizza.\n\n\n\n\n\n Completion and recognition \n\nThe completion and recognition charts provide information about the actions in your assistant.\n\n![Completion and recognition](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/ca9232b3702768f24bb897f48f10778fcda28718/watson-assistant/images/analytics-completion-recognition-2.png)\n\n\n\n Completion \n\nCompletion is the measurement of how often users are able to successfully get through all steps of an action.\n\nYour assistant measures when someone reaches the final step of an action. The completion chart provides an overview of all the actions you have built and how many of these are being completed or not.\n\nCompletion is only applicable when a user question or request matched to an action, and the action starts.\n\nOne action can be triggered multiple times, so to better understand individual action performance, click Action completion to understand each action in more detail.\n\n\n\n\n\n Recognition \n\nRecognition is the measurement of how many requests are being recognized by the assistant and routed into starting an action.\n\nThe recognition chart provides you with a view into how many requests are matched to actions.",
