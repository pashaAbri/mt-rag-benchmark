    "original_text": "Red Hat OpenShift is not the same as Red Hat Virtualization. Red Hat OpenShift is a Kubernetes container platform that provides a trusted environment to run enterprise workloads, while Red Hat Virtualization is a software-defined virtualization solution for traditional and cloud-native applications. They serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.\nRegarding the benefits of Red Hat OpenShift, it allows you to efficiently manage and expand your Red Hat OpenShift workloads across on-premises and off-premises clouds, creating a portable, hybrid solution that functions consistently in multi-cloud scenarios. It enhances the Kubernetes platform with integrated software designed to improve application lifecycle management, operations, and security. You can seamlessly deploy your workloads across hybrid cloud providers and environments, as the platform efficiently orchestrates containerized workloads across a cluster of nodes. Leveraging Kubernetes as the core container orchestration engine, it effectively manages the Docker container images and their lifecycle.\nAs for virtualization, Red Hat OpenShift supports various virtualization options, including using virtual machines as worker nodes in a cluster. However, Red Hat OpenShift itself is not a virtualization solution like Red Hat Virtualization."
