This feature is exclusively available for customers at the Enterprise or Security plan level. \nWhen mTLS is configured, access is only granted to requests with a corresponding client certificate. Upon reaching the application, CIS requests the client certificate. If the client fails to present the certificate, the request is denied. Otherwise, the key exchange proceeds.\nThe Transport Layer Security (TLS) options allow you to control whether visitors can browse your website over a secure connection and, if they do, how IBM Cloud\u00ae Internet Services connects to your origin server. Mutual TLS is not enabled by default. It is an additional service that requires prior authorization and enablement.",

Diagram of an mTLS handshake\n\n\n\n Configuring mutual TLS \n\nMutual TLS is not enabled by default. It is an additional service that requires prior authorization and enablement.\n\nTo obtain authorization, you must submit an IBM Support case.\n\nAfter mTLS is turned on for your account, take the following steps to enable it.\n\n\n\n1. Navigate to the Security page in the CIS UI.\n2. Select the Mutual TLS tab.\n3. Click Enable to enable the feature.\n\n\n\nAfter mTLS is enabled, it cannot be disabled.\n\nTo set up mTLS authentication in the IBM Cloud Internet Services UI for a particular endpoint:\n\n\n\n1. In the Root certificates table, click Add to define a new root certificate.\n2. Paste the certificate content into the content field, provide a name for the Root CA, and add one or more fully qualified domain names (FQDN) of the endpoints that you want to use this certificate. These FQDNs are the hostnames that are used for the resources being protected by the application policy. You must associate the Root CA with the FQDN that the application being protected uses.\n3. Click Save.\n\nIf your zone is using an intermediate certificate in addition to the root certificate, upload the entire chain.\n4.",
