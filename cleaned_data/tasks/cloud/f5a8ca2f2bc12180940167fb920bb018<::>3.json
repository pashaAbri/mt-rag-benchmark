Click the Dialog tab, and then click Create dialog.\n\nWhen you open the dialog editor for the first time, the following nodes are created for you:\n\n\n\n* Welcome: The first node. It contains a greeting that is displayed to your users when they first engage with your assistant. You can edit the greeting.\n\n\n\nThis node is not triggered in dialog flows that are initiated by users. For example, dialogs that are deployed in environments such as messaging channels where customers start the conversation do not process nodes with the welcome special condition.\n\n\n\n* Anything else: The final node. It contains phrases that are used to reply to users when their input is not recognized. You can replace the responses that are provided or add more responses with a similar meaning to add variety to the conversation. You can also choose whether you want your assistant to return each response that is defined in turn or return them in random order.\n\n\n\n2. To add more nodes to the dialog tree, click the More![More icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/kabob.png) icon on the Welcome node, and then select Add node below.\n3. In the If assistant recognizes field, enter a condition that, when met, triggers your assistant to process the node.\n\nTo start off, you typically want to add an intent as the condition. For example, if you add open_account here, it means that you want the response that you will specify in this node to be returned to the user if the user input indicates that the user wants to open an account.\n\nAs you begin to define a condition, a box is displayed that shows you your options.

If you did delete it, don't panic. You can add it back. Just add a dialog node to the end of your dialog tree, and add the anything_else special condition to its If assistant recognizes field.\n\nThe Anything else node provides the following benefits:\n\n\n\n* It prevents your assistant from ever going silent and failing to respond at all to your customers. The Anything else node is what enables your assistant to (if nothing else) say, I'm sorry, I didn't understand. or I can't help you with that.\n* The skill's analytics feature uses this node to learn about the topics that your dialog can't address. The coverage metric looks for occurrences of nodes with the anything_else condition being processed in the user conversation logs. It uses this information to determine the frequency with which your dialog is able to match user requests to intents that can address them. The node is registered by the metric if it conditions on anything_else alone or when it's used in combination with another condition, such as anything_else && positive_feedback.",

The response might be the answer to a question such as Where can I get some gas? or the execution of a command, such as turning on the radio. The intent and entity might be enough information to identify the correct response, or the dialog might ask the user for more input that is needed to respond correctly. For example, if a user asks, Where can I get some food? you might want to clarify whether they want a restaurant or a grocery store, to dine in or take out, and so on. You can ask for more details in a text response and create one or more child nodes to process the new input.\n\nThe dialog is represented graphically in Watson Assistant as a tree. Create a branch to process each intent that you want your conversation to handle. A branch is composed of multiple nodes.\n\n\n\n Dialog nodes \n\nEach dialog node contains, at a minimum, a condition and a response.\n\n![Shows user input going to a box that contains the statement If: CONDITION, Then: RESPONSE](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/node1-empty.png)\n\n\n\n* Condition: Specifies the information that must be present in the user input for this node in the dialog to be triggered. The information is typically a specific intent. It might also be an entity type, an entity value, or a context variable value. See [Conditions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-dialog-builddialog-overview-conditions) for more information.\n* Response: The utterance that your assistant uses to respond to the user. The response can also be configured to show an image or a list of options, or to trigger programmatic actions.",
