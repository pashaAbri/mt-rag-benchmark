To that end, you will create a data lake for your organization using Object Storage. By combining Object Storage and Data Engine, data analysts can query data where it lies using Structured Query Language (SQL). You'll also leverage the Data Engine (previously SQL Query) service in a Jupyter Notebook to conduct a simple analysis. When you're done, allow non-technical users to discover their own insights.\n\n![solution tutorial icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/solution-tutorial.svg) [Build a database-driven Slackbot](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-slack-chatbot-database-watson)Build a database-driven Slackbot Solution tutorial\n\nIn this tutorial, you are going to build a Slackbot which allows to search and create entries in a backend Db2 on Cloud database. The Slackbot is backed by the IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant service. You will integrate Slack and IBM Watson\u00ae Assistant using an Assistant integration. Db2 on Cloud is made available to Watson Assistant as custom extension.\n\n![solution tutorial icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/homepage/solution-tutorial.svg) [Build, deploy, test and monitor a predictive machine learning model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-create-deploy-retrain-machine-learning-model)Build, deploy, test and monitor a predictive machine learning model Solution tutorial\n\nThis tutorial walks you through the process of building a predictive machine learning model, deploying the generated model as an API to be used in your applications and testing the model all of this happening in an integrated and unified self-service experience on IBM Cloud. You will then monitor the deployed model with IBM Watson OpenScale.\n\n!",

With IBM\u00ae Netezza\u00ae Performance Server for IBM Cloud Pak\u00ae for Data as a Service, you can use external tables to access parquet files that are stored outside of your database in data lakes (on AWS S3). Also, you can analyze this data by using the robust and massively parallel Netezza Performance Server execution engine.\n\nExternal data sources use connection strings to specify how you can access an external system. Each connection string describes where your data is placed and how to authenticate to your data source. Each external data source has a definition (schema), but the actual data exists external to the Netezza Performance Server database.\n\nYou cannot backup (nzbackup) and restore (nzrestore) external data source objects.\n\nUse cases for external data source include:\n\n\n\n*  [Running queries against parquet data that is stored in a data lake](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-querying_singularity).\n*  [Ingesting data into Netezza Performance Server](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-ingest_singularity).\n*  [Querying both local and remote data](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/netezza?topic=netezza-merging_singularity).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
