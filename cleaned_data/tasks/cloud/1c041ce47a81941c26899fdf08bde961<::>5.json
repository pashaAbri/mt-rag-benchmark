Delete any models that you do not need. 3. If your models are too important to delete, consider upgrading your plan to one that provides a larger allotment of storage space. 4. After you remove models or model versions, wait an hour before you retry the action that resulted in the error message. Regarding add or delete storage question: In the VMware Solutions console, click Resources > VMware as a Service from the left navigation pane. In the VMware as a Service table, click the Cloud director sites tab, then click an instance name.. Click the Infrastructure tab. On the Clusters tab, click a cluster name to expand its details. Click Edit NFS storage. In the Edit shared storage window, increase or decrease the current sizings for the performance tiers available. Review the new cost, select the confirmation checkbox, and click Change to confirm.",

To free up space, you can take the following actions:\n\n\n\n*  Delete snapshot versions of any models that you do not expect to need to revert to.\n*  Delete any models that you do not need.\n*  If your models are too important to delete, consider upgrading your plan to one that provides a larger allotment of storage space.\n\n\n\nAfter you remove models or model versions, wait an hour before you retry the action that resulted in the error message. It can take up to an hour for the storage space that you freed up to be available for use.\n\nTo manage your monthly bill, if the Admin role is assigned to you and you have a Premium or Standard account, you can set a storage limit on the Service Details page in Knowledge Studio. To see the Service Details page and set the storage limit, from the top navigation bar in Knowledge Studio, click the Settings icon, click the View/modify service details link, and then click the Set storage limit link.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
