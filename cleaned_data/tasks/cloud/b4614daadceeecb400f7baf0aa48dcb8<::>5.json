  "gold_answer": "To secure the phone connection before integration, you can go to the Advanced options tab in the phone integration settings and select one or both of the following options:\n1. Force secure trunking: This option uses Secure Real-Time Transfer Protocol (SRTP) to secure the audio that is transmitted over the phone.\n2. Enable SIP authentication: This option requires SIP digest authentication for all inbound traffic. When this option is selected, the SIP digest user name and password must be configured, and the SIP trunk being used to connect to Assistant must be configured to use only TLS. However, if you use Twilio as your SIP trunk provider, you cannot enable SIP authentication for outbound SIP trunks to Watson Assistant.\nAdditionally, to configure how your assistant interacts with a SIP trunk from an external provider, go to the SIP trunk tab in the phone integration settings and update the SIP trunking integration section. Here, you can list the headers that you want your assistant to use in the \"SIP INVITE headers to extract\" field.",

      "text": "\nIt's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call. This 503 response can then be used by the SIP trunking provider to reroute the call to another region. If you want to take advantage of this capability, open a service ticket against the Watson Assistant service instance that requires disaster recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\n Secure the phone connection \n\nYou can add security to the phone connection by going to the Advanced options tab in the phone integration settings, and selecting one or both of the following options:\n\n\n\n* Force secure trunking: Select this option to use Secure Real-Time Transfer Protocol (SRTP) to secure the audio that is transmitted over the phone.
