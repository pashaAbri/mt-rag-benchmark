  "gold_answer": "You can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. IBM has established relationships with Five9, Genesys, Vonage, and Voximplant. These providers can set up a SIP trunk for your voice traffic and manage access from allowed IP addresses. The network configuration required to support the SIP trunk connection can typically be handled for you with minimal effort. If you need assistance setting up an account with another SIP trunk provider, you can open a support request.",

      "text": "\nPhone integration configuration \n\nIBM Cloud\n\nAfter you have set up the phone integration for your assistant, you can modify the phone integration settings to customize the call behavior.\n\n\n\n Handling call and transfer failures \n\nYou can configure the phone integration to transfer the caller to a human agent if the phone connection fails for any reason. To transfer the caller to a human agent automatically, go to the Advanced tab in the phone integration settings, and make the following configuration selections:\n\n\n\n* SIP target when a call fails: Add the SIP endpoint for your support agent service. Specify a SIP or telephone URI for a general call queue that can redirect requests to other queues. For more information, see [Configuring backup call center support](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant?topic=watson-assistant-deploy-phone-configdeploy-phone-config-transfer-service).\n* Call failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller before it transfers the call to a human agent.\n\n\n\nIf, after you transfer the call to a human, the connection to a live agent fails for any reason, you can configure what to do.\n\n\n\n* Transfer failure message: Add the message you want the assistant to say to a caller if transfer to a live agent fails. The message can be up to 150 characters in length.\n* Disconnect call on transfer failure: Choose whether to disconnect the call after the failure message. This option is enabled by default. If this option is disabled, when a call transfer fails, your assistant can disconnect or process a different action.\n\nIf you choose to leave a call connected despite a transfer failure, Watson Assistant will initiate a new turn to determine the next step. It's important that the Assistant be configured with an Action or webhook that can handle this scenario.\n\n\n\nThe phone integration supports disaster recovery by providing the ability to do a fast failover to another region instead of routing the call to a live agent when a service outage occurs. This is accomplished by sending a SIP 503 response to the upstream SIP trunking provider, instead of auto referring the call to a live agent when failures happen during the setup of a call.",

If you plan to support call transfers, enable Call Transfer (SIP REFER) in your SIP trunk. If you expect to transfer calls to the public switched telephone network (PSTN), also enable PSTN Transfer on your trunk.\n7. Select Numbers from the navigation bar for your SIP trunk, and then do one of the following things:\n\n\n\n* Click Add a number and then Buy a Number.\n* If you already have a number, you can click Add a number and then Add an Existing Number.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use a Lite or Trial Twilio account for testing purposes, then be sure to verify the transfer target.
