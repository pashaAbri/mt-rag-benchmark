A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Secret types in Secrets Manager\n\n Type Programmatic name Kind Description \n\n [Arbitrary secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-arbitrary-secrets) arbitrary Static Arbitrary pieces of sensitive data, including any type of structured or unstructured data, that you can use to access an application or resource. \n [IAM credentials](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-iam-credentials) iam_credentials* Dynamic A dynamically generated service ID and API key that can be used to access an IBM Cloud service that requires IAM authentication. \n [Key-value secrets](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-key-value) kv Static Pieces of sensitive data that is structured in JSON format that you can use to access an application or resource.",

You see an error message similar to the following example:\n\nThe requested action can't be completed because the secret version is locked.\n\nIf you're working with\n\ndynamic secrets, such as IAM credentials, locking your secrets also means that by default, those secrets can't be read or accessed. For more information, see [Why can't I read a locked IAM credentials secret?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-locked-iam-credentials)\n* If a locked secret reaches its expiration date, it stays in the Active state and its data remains accessible to your applications. Secrets Manager moves the secret to the Destroyed state and permanently deletes the expired secret data only after all locks on the secret are removed.\n\nSSL/TLS certificates still reach their defined expiration dates and move into a Destroyed state even if they are locked. For more information, see [Why did my locked certificate move to the Destroyed state?](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/secrets-manager?topic=secrets-manager-locked-certificates)\n* If you try to rotate a secret while its current version is locked and the previous version is unlocked (or if an automatic rotation is scheduled), the request to rotate the secret is allowed. The current secret version becomes the new previous version, retaining its existing locks. A new current version is created without any locks.\n* If you try to rotate a secret while its previous version is locked (or if an automatic rotation is scheduled), your request to rotate the secret is denied. Rotation is allowed only after all locks on the previous secret version are removed.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating locks in the UI \n\nYou can create up to 1000 locks on a secret by using the Secrets Manager UI. Each lock can be used to represent a single application or service that uses your secret.\n\nA secret is considered locked after you attach one or more locks to it. A lock can be applied only on a secret version that contains active payload, or secret data.",
