Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly. This is caused if CocoaPods does not update the Swift version in the Pods project. To fix, select the Pods project and the IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions target.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install.
