  "gold_answer": "There are three main types of clouds: public, private, and hybrid.\nA public cloud consists of shared resources that provide access to a company's resources. It is hosted in a multi-tenant environment on a virtual server and can be accessed from anywhere.\nA private cloud consists of resources that provide access to a company's resources. It is hosted on dedicated hardware, such as a bare metal server, either onsite at the company's office (or across offices) or by a cloud provider. A private cloud can be accessed from anywhere.\nA hybrid cloud is a flexible solution that combines aspects of both public and private clouds. It is hosted both onsite at a company's office or across multiple offices, and by a cloud provider. This allows a hybrid cloud to be accessed from any location, making it an attractive option for many businesses.\n",

The application is cloud-aware, and users can use different end points, depending on the software provider, to use the software. The cloud provider is responsible for all infrastructure and application management, which includes software updates, hardware repairs, and network settings. This model is often used in pay-as-you-go software licensing models.

A public cloud includes a shared set of resources that are provisioned to allow access to a company's resources. It is hosted in a multi-tenant environment on a virtual server, and it can be accessed from anywhere.\n\nA private cloud includes resources that are provisioned to allow access to a company's resources. It is hosted on dedicated hardware, such as a bare metal server, and either onsite at the company's office (or across offices) or by a cloud provider.
