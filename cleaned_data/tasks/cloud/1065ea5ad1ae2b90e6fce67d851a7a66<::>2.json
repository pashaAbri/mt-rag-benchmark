        "text": "\nMobile SDK \n\nIBM Cloud\u00ae Functions provides a mobile SDK for iOS and watchOS devices that enables mobile apps to fire remote triggers and invoke remote actions. A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces. Use a Cloud Foundry-based namespace instead.\n\n\n\n Add the SDK to your app \n\nYou can install the mobile SDK by using CocoaPods, Carthage, or from the source directory.\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with CocoaPods \n\nThe IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions SDK for mobile is available for public distribution through CocoaPods. Assuming CocoaPods is installed, put the following lines into a file called Podfile inside the starter app project directory.\n\ninstall! 'cocoapods', :deterministic_uuids => false\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\ntarget 'MyApp WatchKit Extension' do\npod 'OpenWhisk', :git => 'https://github.com/apache/incubator-openwhisk-client-swift.git', :tag => '0.3.0'\nend\n\nFrom the command line, type pod install. This command installs the SDK for an iOS app with a watchOS extension. Use the workspace file CocoaPods creates for your app to open the project in Xcode.\n\nAfter installation, open your project workspace. You might get the following warning when building: Use Legacy Swift Language Version\u201d (SWIFT_VERSION) is required to be configured correctly for targets which use Swift. Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly.",

Import the Client SDK by adding the following import statement at the beginning of your project file:\n\nimport com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.core.api.;\n2. Initialize the BMSClient SDK in your Android application by adding the initialization code in the onCreate method of the main activity in your Android app, or in a location that works best for your project.\n\nBMSClient.getInstance().initialize(getApplicationContext(), BMSClient.REGION_US_SOUTH); // Make sure that you point to your region\n\nYou must initialize the BMSClient with the bluemixRegion parameter. In the initializer, the bluemixRegion value specifies which IBM Cloud deployment you are using, for example, BMSClient.REGION_US_SOUTH, BMSClient.REGION_UK, or BMSClient.REGION_SYDNEY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Initializing your iOS app \n\nYou can use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to get the BMSCore package.\n\n\n\n1. To install BMSCore by using CocoaPods, add the following lines to your Podfile. If your project doesn't have a Podfile yet, use the pod init command.\n\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'BMSCore'\nend\n\nThen run the pod install command, and open the generated .xcworkspace file. To update to a newer release of BMSCore, use pod update BMSCore.\n\nFor more information about using CocoaPods, see the [CocoaPods Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/index.html).\n2.",
