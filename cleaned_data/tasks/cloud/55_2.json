Use the [Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax\u2026] menu to choose a Swift version or use the Build Settings editor to configure the build setting directly. This is caused if CocoaPods does not update the Swift version in the Pods project. To fix, select the Pods project and the IBM Cloud\u00ae Functions target. Go to Build Settings and change the setting Use Legacy Swift Language Version to no. Alternatively, you can add the following post installation instructions at the end of you Podfile:\n\npost_install do installer\ninstaller.pods_project.targets.each do target\ntarget.build_configurations.each do config\nconfig.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '4.0'\nend\nend\nend\n\n\n\n\n\n Install mobile SDK with Carthage \n\nCreate a file in the project directory for your app and name it Cartfile.

Import the Client SDK by adding the following import statement at the beginning of your project file:\n\nimport com.ibm.mobilefirstplatform.clientsdk.android.core.api.;\n2. Initialize the BMSClient SDK in your Android application by adding the initialization code in the onCreate method of the main activity in your Android app, or in a location that works best for your project.\n\nBMSClient.getInstance().initialize(getApplicationContext(), BMSClient.REGION_US_SOUTH); // Make sure that you point to your region\n\nYou must initialize the BMSClient with the bluemixRegion parameter. In the initializer, the bluemixRegion value specifies which IBM Cloud deployment you are using, for example, BMSClient.REGION_US_SOUTH, BMSClient.REGION_UK, or BMSClient.REGION_SYDNEY.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Initializing your iOS app \n\nYou can use [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) or [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to get the BMSCore package.\n\n\n\n1. To install BMSCore by using CocoaPods, add the following lines to your Podfile. If your project doesn't have a Podfile yet, use the pod init command.\n\nuse_frameworks!\n\ntarget 'MyApp' do\npod 'BMSCore'\nend\n\nThen run the pod install command, and open the generated .xcworkspace file. To update to a newer release of BMSCore, use pod update BMSCore.\n\nFor more information about using CocoaPods, see the [CocoaPods Guides](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/index.html).\n2.",
