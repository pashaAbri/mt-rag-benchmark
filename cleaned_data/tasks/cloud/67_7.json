From the command line, navigate to the project directory and type `carthage update --platform ios`. Carthage will download and build the SDK, creating a directory called `Carthage` in the project directory for your app, and putting an `OpenWhisk.framework` file inside `Carthage/build/iOS`. 3.

Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd openwhisk-client-swift`\n3. Install Carthage: `brew install carthage`\n4. Run `carthage bootstrap` to build the framework.\n5.

A version for Android is not available, so Android developers can use the OpenWhisk REST API directly. The mobile SDK is written in Swift 4 and supports iOS 11 and later releases. You can build the mobile SDK by using Xcode 9.\n\nThe mobile SDK is not supported for IAM-based namespaces.

For instance:\n\nwhisk.baseURL = \"http://localhost:8080\"\n\nIn this example, you use an installation that is running at http://localhost:8080. If you do not specify the baseURL, the mobile SDK uses the instance that is running at [https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com](https://us-south.functions.cloud.ibm.com).\n\nYou can pass in a custom NSURLSession in case you require special network handling. For example, you might have your own Cloud Functions installation that uses self-signed certificates:\n\n// create a network delegate that trusts everything\nclass NetworkUtilsDelegate: NSObject, NSURLSessionDelegate {\nfunc URLSession(session: NSURLSession, didReceiveChallenge challenge: NSURLAuthenticationChallenge, completionHandler: (NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition, NSURLCredential?) -> Void) {\ncompletionHandler(NSURLSessionAuthChallengeDisposition.UseCredential, NSURLCredential(forTrust: challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust!))\n}\n}\n// create an NSURLSession that uses the trusting delegate",
