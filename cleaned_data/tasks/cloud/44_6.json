Red Hat OpenShift clusters build on Kubernetes container orchestration that offers consistency and flexibility for your development lifecycle operations.\n\nYour Red Hat OpenShift workloads can scale across IBM\u2019s global footprint of data centers and multizone regions. At the same time, you\u2019re able to uniformly monitor, log, and secure apps. Because IBM manages the service, you can focus on innovating with high-value IBM Cloud services and middleware, such as AI and analytics. You also have access to Red Hat packaged open-source tools, including your favorite app runtimes, frameworks, databases, and more.\n\nReady to get started? Try out the [creating a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster tutorial](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-openshift_tutorial).\n\nChoice of container platform provider\n: Deploy clusters with Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes installed as the container platform orchestrator.\n: Choose the developer experience that fits your company, or run workloads across both Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes clusters.\n: Built-in integrations from the IBM Cloud console to the Kubernetes dashboard or Red Hat OpenShift web console.\n: Single view and management experience of all your Red Hat OpenShift or community Kubernetes clusters from IBM Cloud.",

As a certified Kubernetes provider, Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud provides intelligent scheduling, self-healing, horizontal scaling, service discovery and load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management. The service also has advanced capabilities around simplified cluster management, container security and isolation policies, the ability to design your own cluster, and integrated operational tools for consistency in deployment.\n\nFor a detailed overview of capabilities and benefits, see [Benefits of using the service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cs_ovbenefits).\n\n\n\n\n\n What container platforms are available for my cluster? \n\nWith IBM Cloud, you can create clusters for your containerized workloads from two different container management platforms: the IBM version of community Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud. The container platform that you select is installed on your cluster master and worker nodes. Later, you can [update the version](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-updateupdate) but can't roll back to a previous version or switch to a different container platform. If you want to use multiple container platforms, create a separate cluster for each.\n\nFor more information, see [Comparison between Red Hat OpenShift and community Kubernetes clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cs_ovopenshift_kubernetes).\n\nKubernetes\n: [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) is a production-grade, open source container orchestration platform that you can use to automate, scale, and manage your containerized apps that run on an Ubuntu operating system.",
