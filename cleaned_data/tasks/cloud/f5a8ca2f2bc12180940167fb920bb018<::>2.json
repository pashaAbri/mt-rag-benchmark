By recognizing the intent expressed in a customer's input, the Watson Assistant service can choose the correct dialog flow for responding to it.\n\n\n\n Intent creation overview \n\n\n\n* Plan the intents for your application.\n\nConsider what your customers might want to do, and what you want your application to be able to handle on their behalf. For example, you might want your application to help your customers make a purchase. If so, you can add a buy_something intent. (The that is added as a prefix to the intent name helps to clearly identify it as an intent.)\n* Teach Watson about your intents.\n\nAfter you decide which business requests that you want your application to handle for your customers, you must teach Watson about them. For each business goal (such as buy_something), you must provide at least 5 examples of utterances that your customers typically use to indicate their goal. For example, I want to make a purchase.\n\nIdeally, find real-world user utterance examples that you can extract from existing business processes. The user examples should be tailored to your specific business. For example, if you are an insurance company, a user example might look more like this, I want to buy a new XYZ insurance plan.\n\nThe examples that you provide are used by your assistant to build a machine learning model that can recognize the same and similar types of utterances and map them to the appropriate intent.\n\n\n\nStart with a few intents, and test them as you iteratively expand the scope of the application.\n\n\n\n\n\n Creating intents \n\n\n\n1. Open your dialog skill. The skill opens to the Intents page.\n2. Select Create intent.\n3. In the Intent name field, type a name for the intent.\n\n\n\n* The intent name can contain letters (in Unicode), numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods.\n* The name cannot consist of .. or any other string of only periods.\n* Intent names cannot contain spaces and must not exceed 128 characters. The following are examples of intent names:\n\n\n\n* weather_conditions",

If IBM makes subsequent updates to a content catalog, the changes are not automatically applied to any intents you added from a catalog.\n\n\n\n\n\n Editing content catalog intents \n\nLike any other intent, after you add content catalog intents to your skill, you can make the following changes to them:\n\n\n\n* Rename intents\n* Delete intents\n* Add, edit, or delete intent user examples\n* Move an example to a different intent",
