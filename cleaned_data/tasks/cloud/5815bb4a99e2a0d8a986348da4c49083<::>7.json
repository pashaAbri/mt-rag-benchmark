A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

There are differences between them. Dynamic secrets have their expiration date and time enforced when their secret data is read or accessed, while static secrets have their expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. With a Secrets Manager, you can create, lease, and centrally manage secrets that are used in IBM Cloud services or your custom-built applications.\n|user|: Which one protects more from vulnerabilities?\n|assistant|: Both dynamic and static secrets have their own ways of protecting against vulnerabilities. Secrets that you create in Secrets Manager can be static or dynamic in nature. A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a dynamic secret has its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed. The static code scan stage runs a static code analyzer tool on the specified app repo codebases. The static-scan task runs a scan on the specified repos. The Dynamic scan stage runs a dynamic application security testing tool to find vulnerabilities in the deployed application.\n|user|: Do they both rotate secrets?\n|assistant|: Both dynamic and static secrets can have their expiration dates enforced, leading to the rotation of the secrets. The key difference lies in when this enforcement occurs. For static secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, for dynamic secrets, the expiration date and time are enforced when the secret data is read or accessed. When trying to rotate a secret, the request's success depends on whether the previous version is locked or not. Automatic rotation is available only for secrets that are generated by Secrets Manager. With IBM Cloud\u00ae Secrets Manager, you can design a strategy for rotating your secrets and sensitive data.\n|user|: What is an IAM credential?\n|assistant|: IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) service securely authenticates users and controls access to all resources consistently in the IBM Cloud Platform. An IAM (Identity and Access Management) credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication. When you create an IAM credential through Secrets Manager, the service creates a service ID and an API key on your behalf. These credentials allow you to authenticate your identity and control your access to various IBM Cloud resources.\n|user|: Can I track my users?\n|assistant|: You can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact. The IBM Cloud Activity Tracker service records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in IBM Cloud. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. Tracking Instances with IBM Cloud Activity Tracker and Access Management (IAM) service allows you to securely authenticate users and control access to all resources consistently in the IBM Cloud Platform. \n|user|: Are there serverless instances?\n|assistant|: Yes, there are serverless instances in the context of IBM Analytics Engine. The IBM Analytics Engine Standard serverless plan for Apache Spark offers a new consumption model using Apache Spark. An Analytics Engine serverless instance does not consume any resources when no workloads are running. When you submit Spark applications, Spark clusters are created in seconds and are spun down as soon as the applications finish running.\n|user|: Explain Spark."
