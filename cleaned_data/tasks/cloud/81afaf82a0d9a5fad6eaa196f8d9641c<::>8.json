Here are some considerations:Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) Evaluate your IAM access permissions to create and manage backups. Volumes Evaluate which volumes are most important to back up. You can create backups of boot and data volumes. A volume with numerous changes and a lengthy retention period requires more attention than a volume with moderate changes. Also, the cumulative size of all backups for a volume can't exceed 10 TB. Backup schedule Determine a backup schedule based on the type of volumes that you're backing up. For example, you might want to back up critical data that changes frequently more often than static data. Retention Determine a retention policy for backups in the backup plan. As subsequent backups are created, keep in mind that you incur costs for each backup that you retain.  You do your first backup  with a seed( a complete , a full backup)using  Delta Technology. With this technology, \"full backups\" are created at each session, but it saves enormous amounts of space on the vault and decreases the amount of time each subsequent backup takes to complete. Also . Administrators can set backups to follow an hourly, daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files.",

It's all dependent on your system. System files vary by system O/S and service packs. Usually there are several thousand of them. MS Windows makes a dynamic list of these DLLs when you include them in the backup. By including the system files, you can recover from corrupted system files, or if you accidentally remove some service packs, or want to recover with a bare-metal restore. You can return to the state of the backup without having to reinstall the O/S from the installation kit, and then installing each service pack separately.\n\nNo user data file is included in System state backup. A system state backup job must be configured as a stand-alone job. There mustn't be any other data source that is included in the System State backup job.\n* What happens to open files?",

      "text": "\nWhen you create a new retention scheme or modify an existing retention, make sure that the Archiving option is not selected. Archiving is not supported.\n* What is Delta Technology?\n\nThe first backup is a \"seed\" (a complete, full backup), the next and subsequent ones are \"deltas\" (that is, changes only), but they are equivalent to, and still considered a \"full backup\". That is, you're able to restore all or any files from it. With this technology, \"full backups\" are created at each session, but it saves enormous amounts of space on the vault and decreases the amount of time each subsequent backup takes to complete.\n* Are the backups secure?\n\nBy default all encryption over the wire (OTW) is encrypted with AES 256-bit encryption. You can also choose to store data in encrypted format by using AES 256-bit.\n\nYou must remember your encryption password. Your data can't be restored without your password. If you lose your password, you can't get your data back.\n\nCompression ratios allow for zero compression to a maximum ratios compression that, depending on file type, might be compressed anywhere from 20 percent to 30 percent.\n* What information is stored with system state backups?\n\nThe system state backups include, but aren't limited to COM + class registration database, registry, boot files, system files, performance counter. It's all dependent on your system. System files vary by system O/S and service packs. Usually there are several thousand of them. MS Windows makes a dynamic list of these DLLs when you include them in the backup. By including the system files, you can recover from corrupted system files, or if you accidentally remove some service packs, or want to recover with a bare-metal restore. You can return to the state of the backup without having to reinstall the O/S from the installation kit, and then installing each service pack separately.\n\nNo user data file is included in System state backup. A system state backup job must be configured as a stand-alone job. There mustn't be any other data source that is included in the System State backup job.\n* What happens to open files?",

      "text": "\nPlanning backups \n\nWhen you plan a strategy for backing up your Block Storage for VPC volumes, you might find this checklist helpful to configure and use the backup service.\n\n\n\n Planning backups \n\nConsider the following prerequisites before you set up the VPC Backup Service.\n\n\n\nTable 1. Checklist for planning backup policies\n\n Item Considerations \n\n Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) Evaluate your [IAM access permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-backup-service-managebaas-vpc-iam) to create and manage backups. \n Volumes Evaluate which volumes are most important to back up. You can create backups of boot and data volumes. A volume with numerous changes and a lengthy retention period requires more attention than a volume with moderate changes. Also, the cumulative size of all backups for a volume can't exceed 10 TB. \n Backup schedule Determine a backup schedule based on the type of volumes that you're backing up. For example, you might want to back up critical data that changes frequently more often than static data. \n Retention Determine a retention policy for backups in the backup plan. As subsequent backups are created, keep in mind that you incur costs for each backup that you retain. Deleting older backups keeps costs down. \n Backup plans Decide on the number of backup plans that you need for a policy. For example, you can have separate plans for daily backups, weekly, and monthly. \n Interface Choose the UI, CLI, API, or Terraform for creating and managing your backups. \n Billing Think about the number of backup snapshots that you want to take and other [billing considerations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-snapshots-vpc-about&interface=apisnapshots_vpc_considerations) as the number of backup snapshots grows. \n Volume restore Evaluate when you might want to restore a volume from a backup. Keep in mind that restoring from a backup is a manual operation and not immediate such as a disaster recovery solution.",

Administrators can set backups to follow an hourly, daily, weekly, or custom schedule that targets full systems, specific directories, or even individual files. Extra plug-ins allow for compatibility with software like MS Exchange and MS SQL, and other types of third-party software to perform a Bare Metal Restore, when necessary.\n\nFor more information about IBM Cloud Backup for Classic services, see [Getting Started with IBM Cloud Backup for Classic services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Backup?topic=Backup-getting-started).\n\n\n\n\n\n  R1Soft Continuous Data Protection \n\nContinuous Data Protection is a high-performance backup software from R1Soft that is used for backup of both physical and virtual devices. Continuous Data Protection consists of three main components: the R1Soft server, the agent, and the database plug-ins, which are available for purchase separately from the first two components. Because R1Soft Continuous Data Protection is a third-party backup solution, interactions with Continuous Data Protection take place entirely outside of IBM Cloud\u00ae proprietary interfaces. However, R1Soft Continuous Data Protection passwords can be tracked and stored within IBM Cloud console. All other interactions with R1Soft Continuous Data Protection are documented on the R1Soft website.\n\nFor more information about R1Soft Continuous Data Protection backup services, see [R1Soft Documentation](http://wiki.r1soft.com/display/ServerBackupManager/Home).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
