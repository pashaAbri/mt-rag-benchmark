For more information about UUIDs, see [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122.html).\n\n\n\n* For web chat, if you do not pass an identifier for the user when the session begins, the web chat creates one for you. It creates a first-party cookie with a generated anonymous ID. The cookie remains active for 45 days. If the same user returns to your site later in the month and chats with your assistant again, the web chat integration recognizes the user.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Service API versioning",
