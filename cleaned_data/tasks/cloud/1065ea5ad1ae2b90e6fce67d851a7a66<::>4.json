Clone the IBM Cloud Functions SDK for mobile repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/openwhisk/openwhisk-client-swift.git`\n2. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd openwhisk-client-swift`\n3. Install Carthage: `brew install carthage`\n4. Run `carthage bootstrap` to build the framework.\n5. Add the `OpenWhisk.framework` file to the embedded frameworks in your Xcode project.",

Create a directory on your local workstation that is named myapp and navigate into it. In this directory, save all the files that are required to build the image and to run your app.\n\nmkdir myapp && cd myapp\n2. Create a file called server.js and copy the following source code into it.\n\nconst http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function (request, response) {\nresponse.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'});\nresponse.end( \"Hello worldn\" );\n}).listen(8080);\n\nThis example uses Node.js. You can substitute code from any [supported runtime](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-plan-buildbuild-buildpack-strat).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4: Deploying your application \n\nPush your code to Code Engine by using the application create command. You must provide a name for your application and the location of the source code. The following example creates an application called myapp that uses the buildpack strategy and provides the location for the source code in the current directory (.).\n\nibmcloud ce app create --name myapp --build-source . --strategy buildpacks\n\nExample output\n\nCreating application 'myapp'...\nPackaging files to upload from source path '.'...\nSubmitting build run 'myapp-run-220999-210706331'...\nCreating image 'private.us.icr.io/ce--6ef04-khxrbwa0lci/app-myapp:220418-0207-askql'...\nWaiting for build run to complete...\nBuild run status: 'Running'\nBuild run completed successfully.",

This will relieve SDK users from focusing on configuration-related functionality and will allow applications using your SDK to be flexible and avoid 'hard-coding' configuration information inside the application code.\n\nIf you build this capability into your SDK, you must document this mechanism clearly with examples.\n\n\n\n\n\n Requests \n\nMost networking operations in your Swift SDK should be asynchronous. DispatchGroups and other semaphores can be used for synchronous operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n Using swift-sdk-core \n\n[IBM swift-sdk-core](https://github.com/IBM/swift-sdk-core), formerly watson-developer-cloud/RestKit provides configuration and authentication support.
