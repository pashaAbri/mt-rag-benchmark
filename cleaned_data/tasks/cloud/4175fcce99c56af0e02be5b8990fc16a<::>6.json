      "text": "\nPricing for VPC infrastructure varies based on regional location and sustained usage.\n\nThis information applies to VPC worker nodes only.\n\nRegional uplift charges\n: When you create a cluster on VPC infrastructure, the worker nodes might incur an uplift charge that varies by the [multizone location](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-regions-and-zoneszones-vpc) that you create the cluster in. The uplift charge is a percentage (%) of the hourly rate (r), and is added to the hourly rate of the worker node. The total hourly rate cost for a worker node can be calculated as r + (r \u00d7 %). In the [Red Hat OpenShift cluster creation console](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/create?platformType=openshift), this uplift is reflected in the pricing calculator as you configure your cluster details. The following table describes the pricing uplift by region.\n: For a table that describes the pricing uplift by region, see [Regional pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs).\n\nSustained usage discounts\n: For virtual server instances that are billed at an hourly rate, discounted prices depend on how long the instance runs during the billing month. For more information, expand the Sustained usage discounts on IBM Cloud Virtual Servers for VPC section on the [Pricing for VPC](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/provision/vs) page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Estimating costs \n\nSee [Estimating your costs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/billing-usage?topic=billing-usage-costcost).\n\nKeep in mind that some charges are not reflected in the estimate, such as tiered pricing for increased hourly usage. For more information, see [Understanding costs for your clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-costscosts-for-clusters).\n\n\n\n\n\n Managing costs",
