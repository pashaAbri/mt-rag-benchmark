You can't access your worker nodes by using the VPC dashboard. However, you can manage your worker nodes by using the IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service console, CLI, or API. The virtual machines that make up your worker nodes are dedicated to you and you are responsible to request timely updates so that your worker node OS and IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service components apply the latest security updates and patches.\n\n\n\nFor more information, see [Your responsibilities by using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-responsibilities_iks).\n\nUse the ibmcloud ks worker update[command](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-clics_worker_update) regularly (such as monthly) to deploy updates and security patches to the operating system and to update the Kubernetes version that your worker nodes run. When updates are available, you are notified when you view information about the master and worker nodes in the IBM Cloud console or CLI, such as with the ibmcloud ks clusters ls or ibmcloud ks workers ls --cluster <cluster_name> commands. Worker node updates are provided by IBM as a full worker node image that includes the latest security patches. To apply the updates, the worker node must be reimaged and reloaded with the new image. Keys for the root user are automatically rotated when the worker node is reloaded.\n\n\n\n\n\n How does my worker node setup look? \n\nThe following image shows the components that are set up for every worker node to protect your worker node from malicious attacks.\n\nThe image does not include components that ensure secure end-to-end communication to and from the worker node.

These worker nodes virtual machines and all the worker node components are dedicated to you only and are not shared with other IBM customers. However, the underlying hardware is shared with other IBM customers. For more information, see [Virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm). You manage the worker nodes through the automation tools that are provided by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, such as the API, CLI, or console. Unlike classic clusters, you don't see VPC compute worker nodes in your infrastructure portal or separate infrastructure bill, but instead manage all maintenance and billing activity for the worker nodes from IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Worker nodes include the same [components](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-archworker-components) as described in the Classic architecture. Community Kubernetes worker nodes run on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64, 16.04 x86_64 (deprecated). \n Cluster networking Your worker nodes are created in a VPC subnet in the zone that you specify. By default, the public and private cloud service endpoints for your cluster are enabled. Communication between the master and worker nodes is over the private network. Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands. You can optionally set up your cluster to communicate with on-prem services by setting up a VPC VPN on the private network. \n App networking You can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service for your apps in the cluster, which automatically provisions a VPC load balancer in your VPC outside the cluster. The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes. For more information, see [Exposing apps with VPC load balancers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas). Calico is used as the cluster networking policy fabric.",

Instead, you manage all maintenance and billing activity for the worker nodes through IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Your worker node instances are connected to certain VPC instances that do reside in your infrastructure account, such as the VPC subnet or storage volumes. For dedicated hosts, the dedicated host price covers the vCPU, memory, and any instance storage to be used by any workers placed on the host.
