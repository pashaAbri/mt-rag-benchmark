Click the Assistants icon ![Assistants menu icon](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/417db917d18067d9dcc4cf2612564a9a87c3ddc8/assistant/images/nav-ass-icon.png).\n2. Click Create assistant.\n3. Add details about the new assistant:\n\n\n\n* Name: A name no more than 100 characters in length. A name is required.\n* Description: An optional description no more than 200 characters in length.\n\n\n\n4. Click Create assistant.\n5. Add a skill to the assistant.\n\nNote: You can choose to add an existing skill or create a new one.\n\nSee [Adding a skill to an assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-add).\n\n\n\n\n\n Assistant limits \n\nThe number of assistants you can create depends on your Watson Assistant [plan type](https://www.ibm.com/products/watson-assistant/pricing/). There is also a limit of 100 assistants per service instance.\n\nAfter 30 days of inactivity, an unused assistant in a Lite plan service instance might be deleted to free up space. See [Changing the inactivity timeout setting](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-settings) for more information on the subject.\n\nYou can connect one skill of each type to your assistant. The number of skills you can build differs depending on the plan you have. See [Skill limits](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-addskill-add-limits) for more details.",

      "text": "\nAdding a skill to your assistant \n\nCustomize your assistant by adding to it the skills it needs to satisfy your customers' goals.\n\nYou can create the following types of skills:\n\n\n\n* Dialog skill: Uses Watson natural language processing and machine learning technologies to understand user questions and requests, and respond to them with answers that are authored by you.\n* Search skill: For a given user query, uses the IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery service to search a data source of your self-service content and return an answer.\n\n\n\nTypically, you create a skill of each type first. Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.",
