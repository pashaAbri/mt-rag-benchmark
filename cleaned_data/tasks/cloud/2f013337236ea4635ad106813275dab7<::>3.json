Data Integrity and Long-term Data Retention: Immutable Object Storage preserves electronic records and maintains data integrity. It ensures that data is stored in a WORM (Write-Once-Read-Many), no-erasable and non-rewritable manner, which can be beneficial for industries like Financial, Healthcare, and Media content archives where data integrity is crucial. \n 2. Compliance: Immutable Object Storage can help organizations comply with certain regulations like SEC Rule 17a-4(f), FINRA Rule 4511(c), and CFTC Rule 1.31(c)-(d) that govern electronic records storage and retention. When using immutable Object Storage, it is the client's responsibility to check for and ensure whether any of the feature capabilities that are discussed can be used to satisfy and comply with the key rules around electronic records storage and retention governed by the above-mentioned regulations.\nDisadvantages:  \n1. Limited Availability: Immutable Object Storage is available in certain regions only. Users outside these regions may not be able to use this feature. \n2. Pricing: It requires a Standard pricing plan, which could be a disadvantage for users looking for more affordable options.  \n3. No High-speed Transfer: It isn't possible to use Aspera high-speed transfer with buckets with a retention policy. This could potentially slow down the data transfer process.  \n4. Irreversible: Once permanent retention is enabled, it can't be reversed. Objects uploaded that use a permanent retention period cannot be deleted. This means users need to be sure about their need to permanently store objects. \n5. Legal Holds: The retention policy is enforced until the end of a retention period and the removal of any legal holds. This could potentially cause issues if there are legal disputes or investigations. Please note that the actual advantages and disadvantages may vary depending on the specific use case and requirements.\nTo assist clients in making informed decisions, IBM engaged Cohasset Associates Inc. to conduct an independent assessment of IBM\u2019s Immutable Object Storage.\n\n\n|user|: Are Cohasset Associates, Inc., a legal or IT management consulting firm?\n|assistant|: Cohasset Associates, Inc. is an IT management consulting firm engaged by IBM to conduct an independent assessment of IBM\u2019s Immutable Object Storage.
