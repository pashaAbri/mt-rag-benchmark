These worker nodes virtual machines and all the worker node components are dedicated to you only and are not shared with other IBM customers. However, the underlying hardware is shared with other IBM customers. For more information, see [Virtual machines](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodesvm). You manage the worker nodes through the automation tools that are provided by IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, such as the API, CLI, or console. Unlike classic clusters, you don't see VPC compute worker nodes in your infrastructure portal or separate infrastructure bill, but instead manage all maintenance and billing activity for the worker nodes from IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service. Worker nodes include the same [components](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-service-archworker-components) as described in the Classic architecture. Community Kubernetes worker nodes run on Ubuntu 18.04 x86_64, 16.04 x86_64 (deprecated). \n Cluster networking Your worker nodes are created in a VPC subnet in the zone that you specify. By default, the public and private cloud service endpoints for your cluster are enabled. Communication between the master and worker nodes is over the private network. Authenticated external users can communicate with the master over the public network, such as to run kubectl commands. You can optionally set up your cluster to communicate with on-prem services by setting up a VPC VPN on the private network. \n App networking You can create a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service for your apps in the cluster, which automatically provisions a VPC load balancer in your VPC outside the cluster. The load balancer is multizonal and routes requests for your app through the private NodePorts that are automatically opened on your worker nodes. For more information, see [Exposing apps with VPC load balancers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas). Calico is used as the cluster networking policy fabric.",
