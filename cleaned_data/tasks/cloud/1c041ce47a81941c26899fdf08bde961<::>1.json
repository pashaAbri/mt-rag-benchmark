However, do not use these kinds of compressed files due to performance reasons. 5. If the format of the input objects is CSV and a delimiter other than the default , (comma) is used, you must specify the delimiter by using the FIELDS TERMINATED BY option of the STORED AS clause.

From Data objects, select the database and schema in which you want to run the query.\nIf you do not pick a schema, the default database schema is selected.\n3.  Type the SQL query that you want to run.\nIf your query is a select statement, a Set Limit option shows up to allow you to specify how many rows of data you would like to retrieve. The default is No limit.\n\nIn the Worksheet settings you can specify your Default maximum number of rows limit in result. If you decide, however, to add a limit clause in a select statement that is greater than your Default maximum number of rows limit in result, for example: select * from table1 limit 10;, the Results field shows the smaller value of these two parameters.\n\nIn the Worksheet settings you can also specify the Statement separator you want to use. A semicolon (\";\") is the default Statement separator and you must change it to an ampersand (\"&\") when your queries contain semicolons (\";\") to avoid errors.\n4.  When you input the information, you can do one of the following:\n\n\n\n*  Click Run to run the query.\nThe results of the query are displayed in the panel.\n*  Click the floppy disk icon that is in the SQLworksheet toolbar to save the query as a template.\nThe saved query is added to Saved queries and Queries > Recent Queries.\n*  Click Clear to clear the query.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

You can use the Query workspace interface in IBM\u00ae watsonx.data to run SQL queries and scripts against your data.\n\nThe Query workspace has the following components:\n\n\n\n*  Data objects: To view the engines, catalogs, schemas, tables, and columns.\n*  Engine: To select an engine and view the associated catalogs.\n*  Saved queries: To view the saved queries.\n*  Worksheet: To write SQL queries.\n\n\n\nThe Query workspace page provides basic options to undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, save, clear, and delete.\n\nFormat selection option is enabled only when an SQL statement in a query worksheet is selected. The Format worksheet option formats all the content in the worksheet. Comment selection is used to explain sections of SQL statements.\n\nThe Delete option is enabled only after an SQL query is saved.\n\nTo run the SQL queries, do the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.  Log in to the watsonx.data console.\n2.  From the navigation menu, select SQL. The Query workspace page opens.\n3.  Select an engine from the Engine drop-down.\n4.  Select the catalog, schema, table, or column in which you want to run the query.\n5.  Click the overflow menu and select the required query.\n\n\n\n*  For a catalog and schema, you can run the Generate Path query.\n*  For a table, you can run the Generate path, Generate SELECT, Generate ALTER, and Generate DROP query.\n*  For a column, you can run the Generate path, Generate SELECT, and Generate DROP query.\n\n\n\n6.  Click the Save icon to save the query. A Save query confirmation dialog appears.\n7.  Click Save.\n8.  Click the Run button to run the query.\n9.
