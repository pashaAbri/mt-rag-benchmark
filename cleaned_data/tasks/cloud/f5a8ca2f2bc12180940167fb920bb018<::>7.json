      "text": "\nAdding a skill to your assistant \n\nCustomize your assistant by adding to it the skills it needs to satisfy your customers' goals.\n\nYou can create the following types of skills:\n\n\n\n* Dialog skill: Uses Watson natural language processing and machine learning technologies to understand user questions and requests, and respond to them with answers that are authored by you.\n* Search skill: For a given user query, uses the IBM Watson\u00ae Discovery service to search a data source of your self-service content and return an answer.\n\n\n\nTypically, you create a skill of each type first. Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.",

To see the documentation for the new Watson Assistant, please go [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/watson-assistant).\n\n\n\n Adding skills to your assistant \n\nCustomize your assistant by adding to it the skills it needs to satisfy your customers' goals.\n\nConversational skills return responses that are authored by you to answer common questions, while a search skill searches for and returns passages from existing self-service content.\n\nYou can add the following types of skills to your assistant:\n\n\n\n* Conversational skills: Understand and address questions or requests that your customers typically ask about. You provide information about the subjects or tasks that your users need help with, and how they ask about them, and the product dynamically builds a machine learning model that is tailored to understand the same and similar user requests.\n\n\n\n* Actions skill : Offers a simple interface where anyone can build a conversational flow for your assistant to follow. The complex process of training data creation occurs behind the scenes automatically. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-addskill-add-actions-skill)\n* Dialog skill: Offers a set of editors that you use to define both your training data and the conversation. The conversation is represented as a dialog tree. You use the graphical dialog editor to create a script of sorts for your assistant to read from when it interacts with your customers. The dialog keys off the common customer goals that you teach it to recognize, and provides useful responses.
