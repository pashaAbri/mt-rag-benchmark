  "gold_answer": "The CIS Kubernetes Benchmark is a framework of specific steps to configure Kubernetes more securely and with standards that are commensurate to various industry regulations. It is published by the Center for Internet Security (CIS). When a new Kubernetes version is released, IBM engineers compare the default configuration of a cluster that runs that Kubernetes version against the benchmark and publishes the results in the IBM Cloud documentation. The benchmark recommendations are provided by the Center for Internet Security, and it covers recommendations for master components, etcd, control plane configurations, worker nodes, and policies such as for users, network, and pod security.",

      "text": "\nAs a security administrator or auditor, you might want to compare your company's internal standards and external regulatory requirements with the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark. The benchmark recommendations are provided by the Center for Internet Security, not by IBM. IBM might not configure default settings in a way that meets every recommendation, but documents whether the recommendation is met to help you in your review. For example, you might use the benchmark in an audit to confirm that basic security measures are in place, and to identify areas where you might enhance your security.\n\n\n\n What does the benchmark cover? \n\nThe benchmark covers recommendations for master components, etcd, control plane configurations, worker nodes, and policies such as for users, network, and pod security.\n\n\n\n\n\n What do the benchmark recommendations mean? \n\nThe benchmark recommendations have scoring, levels, result status, and responsibilities as follows.\n\n\n\n* Scoring\n\n\n\n* Scored: The overall benchmark score increases or decreases depending on whether the recommendation is met.\n* Not scored: The overall benchmark score is not impacted, whether the recommendation is met.\n\n\n\n* Levels\n\n\n\n* Level 1: Practical security measures that can be configured without inhibiting the service.\n* Level 2: More in-depth security measures that might reduce the performance or functionality of a service.\n\n\n\n* Result\n\n\n\n* Pass: The service complies with the benchmark recommendation.\n* Fail: The service does not comply with the benchmark recommendation by default. Refer to the remediation section for an explanation and possible actions that you can take to comply with the benchmark recommendation.\n\n\n\n* Responsibility\n\n\n\n* IBM: IBM is responsible for configuring the setting that the benchmark recommends.\n* Shared: You and IBM share responsibility for configuring the setting that the benchmark recommends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n What parts of the benchmark am I responsible for? \n\nBecause IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is a managed offering, IBM already configures many security settings for you. For example, IBM manages and automatically applies updates to your cluster master. For your worker nodes, IBM provides security and version updates, but you must apply the updates. You are also responsible for your workload applications and data.",
