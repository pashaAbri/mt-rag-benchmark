  "gold_answer": "Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is the network infrastructure behind virtualizing network services such as routers, firewalls, and load balancers that were traditionally run on proprietary hardware. Those services, called Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), are packaged as virtual machines (VMs) on commodity hardware, which allows service providers to run their networks on standard servers instead of proprietary ones. The Virtual Network Function (VNF) data network interface is also attached to a VPC security group.  It ensure that the security group has inbound rules that allow traffic on the pool health port that is set up between the NLB and the VNF. Additionally the Virtual Network Function (VNF) must share one subnet with the Network Load Balancer (NLB).   Routing public internet \"ingress\" traffic and auto-scaling  services are not supported by VNF.\n                                 ",

If any node is over 80% in either CPU or memory usage, consider provisioning more nodes or reducing your workload.Secondly if all worker nodes in a cluster, or in a single zone, subnet, or VLAN are affected, you can open an initial support ticket without gathering data.

Before opening a support ticket, it is recommended to review the information and follow any troubleshooting steps in Debugging worker nodes, Worker node states, and Troubleshooting worker nodes in Critical or NotReady state. To gather worker node data, you can use the command 'kubectl top node' (for Kubernetes clusters) or 'oc top node' (for OpenShift clusters), which will display the CPU and memory usage of each node and once you have gathered this information, include it in your support ticket when you open one.                        \n|user|: How can i update a classic worker node?\n|assistant|: An update is available for your worker nodes in a classic infrastructure cluster. As security updates and patches are put in place for the API server and other master components, you must be sure that the worker nodes remain in sync. You can make two types of updates: updating only the patch version, or updating the major.minor version with the patch version. For Classic clusters with a storage solution such as OpenShift Data Foundation you must cordon, drain, and replace each worker node sequentially. If you deployed OpenShift Data Foundation to a subset of worker nodes in your cluster, then after you replace the worker node, you must then edit the ocscluster resource to include the new worker node.You can update the master Kubernetes version with the ibmcloud ks cluster master updatecommand. Remember that your worker nodes can be only up to two versions behind the master version (n-2). The worker node IP address remains the same after the update operation.\n|user|: Major. menor update.\n|assistant|:  To determine the type of update that is available, compare your current worker node versions to the latest worker node fix pack version in the Red Hat OpenShift version change log. Major updates are indicated by the first digit in the version label (4.x.x), minor updates are indicated by the second digit (x.7.x) and patch updates are indicated by the trailing digits (x.x.23_1528_openshift).Major.minor: A major.minor update moves up the Kubernetes version of the worker node to the same version as the master. This type of update often includes changes to the Kubernetes API or other behaviors that you must prepare your cluster for. Remember that your worker nodes can only be one version behind the master version (n-1). You can update the classic worker node to the same patch by using the ibmcloud oc worker update command.             \n|user|: parts of a tag.\n|assistant|: A tag consists of multiple parts as X.Y.Z-.[hash] where X represents the major version of an image; Y represents the minor version of an image and Z represents an incremental ID that determines the latest patched minor version.Depending on the tag that you use, you must consider upgrading the logging agent image in your DevOps maintenance plan, to resolve vulnerabilities and apply agent enhancements and agent bug fixes. Moreover  Tags are case-sensitive, and the maximum length of a tag is 128 characters.  The characters that are permitted to name tags are A-Z, 0-9, spaces, underscore, hyphen, period, and colon. Colons turn the tag into a string where you can isolate two logical parts, like a key:value pair. You can't use a colon in a tag without creating this pairing. A comma separate tags and can't be used within the tag name itself. If you add PII information in the name, you might be disclosing sensitive data to others in the same account.When you define your tags, do not add sensitive information in the tag name.Tags are visible to all members of an account.To control tag visibility, circulate tagging guidelines, and let users know that tags are visible account-wide.  Define the log ingestion strategy. Additionally  Ttags are accessible throughout an instance with the proper permissions. While the true organizational power of using tags as an organizational principle scales with you, you can access tags on an individual basis as well.\n|user|: node data\n|assistant|: I am not sure what you would like to know about node data but I can inform you that there are  some sort of nodes   For instance  ordering node  that collects transactions from network members, orders the transactions and bundles them into blocks. Also known as orderer. Another one is Peer that is a blockchain network resource that provides the services to execute and validate transactions, and maintain ledgers. The peer runs smart contract and is the holder of transaction history and the current state of assets on ledgers. They are owned and managed by organizations and are joined to channels.  Additionally to those two, CA is another node that  issues certificates to all network participants (peers, ordering services, clients, admins, and so on). These certificates, which include a signing certificate and private key, allow network participants to communicate, authenticate, and ultimately transact. These CAs will create all of the identities and certificates that belong to your organization, in addition to defining the organization itself. You can then use those identities to deploy nodes, create admin identities, and submit transactions.                   \n|user|: NodeSync\n|assistant|: NodeSync  is a continuous repair service that runs automatically in the background to validate that your data is in sync on all replicas and reduces the need for manual repairs. For operational simplicity and performance, Databases for DataStax enables the NodeSync service on all key spaces and tables to handle node repairs. You can also manually create tables with NodeSync enabled so that the service can repair the tables' data when necessary while the automation enables NodeSync . If a NodeSync-enabled table is targeted , manual nodetool repair or a repair operation from the OpsCenter node administration menu fails to run  .                           \n|user|: Worker node\n|assistant|:  If you are asking about worker nodes With IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, they are instances managed by your cluster through virtual machines. Those worker nodes virtual machines and all the worker node components are dedicated to you only and are not shared with other IBM customers .You are responsible to request timely updates to the worker nodes to ensure that the worker node OS and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud components apply the latest security updates and patches. Nevertheless the underlying hardware is shared with other IBM customers. Worker nodes carry the deployments and services that make up your app. When you host workloads in the public cloud, you want to ensure that your app is protected from being accessed, changed, or monitored by an unauthorized user or software Additionally worker nodes in standard clusters are provisioned in to your IBM Cloud infrastructure account. \n|user|: Red Hat OpenShift\n|assistant|: Red Hat OpenShift is a  Kubernetes container platform that provides a trusted environment to run enterprise workloads. It extends the Kubernetes platform with built-in software to enhance app lifecycle development, operations, and security. There is the Red Hat OpeShfit on IBM Cloud service, where  IBM sets up and helps you manage a cluster of worker nodes that come installed with the OpenShift Container Platform container orchestration software. Your Red Hat OpenShift workloads can scale across IBM\u2019s global footprint of data centers and multizone regions. At the same time, you\u2019re able to uniformly monitor, log, and secure apps. Additionally  is designed especially to accelerate your containerized app delivery processes that run on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 operating system. You can orchestrate and scale your existing Red Hat OpenShift workloads across on-prem and off-prem clouds for a portable, hybrid solution that works the same in multicloud scenarios. \n|user|: Changing a little bit of subject, what  would be the services of the Virtual Network Functions?"

If you add PII information in the name, you might be disclosing sensitive data to others in the same account.When you define your tags, do not add sensitive information in the tag name.Tags are visible to all members of an account.To control tag visibility, circulate tagging guidelines, and let users know that tags are visible account-wide.  Define the log ingestion strategy. Additionally  Ttags are accessible throughout an instance with the proper permissions. While the true organizational power of using tags as an organizational principle scales with you, you can access tags on an individual basis as well.\n|user|: node data\n|assistant|: I am not sure what you would like to know about node data but I can inform you that there are  some sort of nodes   For instance  ordering node  that collects transactions from network members, orders the transactions and bundles them into blocks. Also known as orderer. Another one is Peer that is a blockchain network resource that provides the services to execute and validate transactions, and maintain ledgers. The peer runs smart contract and is the holder of transaction history and the current state of assets on ledgers. They are owned and managed by organizations and are joined to channels.  Additionally to those two, CA is another node that  issues certificates to all network participants (peers, ordering services, clients, admins, and so on). These certificates, which include a signing certificate and private key, allow network participants to communicate, authenticate, and ultimately transact. These CAs will create all of the identities and certificates that belong to your organization, in addition to defining the organization itself. You can then use those identities to deploy nodes, create admin identities, and submit transactions.                   \n|user|: NodeSync\n|assistant|: NodeSync  is a continuous repair service that runs automatically in the background to validate that your data is in sync on all replicas and reduces the need for manual repairs. For operational simplicity and performance, Databases for DataStax enables the NodeSync service on all key spaces and tables to handle node repairs. You can also manually create tables with NodeSync enabled so that the service can repair the tables' data when necessary while the automation enables NodeSync . If a NodeSync-enabled table is targeted , manual nodetool repair or a repair operation from the OpsCenter node administration menu fails to run  .                           \n|user|: Worker node\n|assistant|:  If you are asking about worker nodes With IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, they are instances managed by your cluster through virtual machines. Those worker nodes virtual machines and all the worker node components are dedicated to you only and are not shared with other IBM customers .You are responsible to request timely updates to the worker nodes to ensure that the worker node OS and Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud components apply the latest security updates and patches. Nevertheless the underlying hardware is shared with other IBM customers. Worker nodes carry the deployments and services that make up your app. When you host workloads in the public cloud, you want to ensure that your app is protected from being accessed, changed, or monitored by an unauthorized user or software Additionally worker nodes in standard clusters are provisioned in to your IBM Cloud infrastructure account. \n|user|: Red Hat OpenShift\n|assistant|: Red Hat OpenShift is a  Kubernetes container platform that provides a trusted environment to run enterprise workloads. It extends the Kubernetes platform with built-in software to enhance app lifecycle development, operations, and security. There is the Red Hat OpeShfit on IBM Cloud service, where  IBM sets up and helps you manage a cluster of worker nodes that come installed with the OpenShift Container Platform container orchestration software. Your Red Hat OpenShift workloads can scale across IBM\u2019s global footprint of data centers and multizone regions. At the same time, you\u2019re able to uniformly monitor, log, and secure apps. Additionally  is designed especially to accelerate your containerized app delivery processes that run on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 operating system. You can orchestrate and scale your existing Red Hat OpenShift workloads across on-prem and off-prem clouds for a portable, hybrid solution that works the same in multicloud scenarios. \n|user|: Changing a little bit of subject, what  would be the services of the Virtual Network Functions?"

These services, called Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), are packaged as virtual machines (VMs) on commodity hardware, which allows service providers to run their networks on standard servers instead of proprietary ones. This third-party software interacts with the IBM Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controller to offer easy configuration, centralized management, and lower operational costs.\n\nWorking along with IBM Cloud\u00ae Schematics (Infrastructure as Code) and the IBM Content catalog, customers are able to instantiate best-in-network solutions to manage their workload.\n\nBenefits include:\n\n\n\n*  Instantiating virtual network services and modifying configurations without the need to deploy new network hardware.\n*  Rapid service delivery with the agility to scale well above physical hardware.\n*  Centralized policy control.\n*  Using the same routers, firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs in IBM Cloud that were used in physical hardware or other cloud providers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
