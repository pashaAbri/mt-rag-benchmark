  "gold_answer": "Of course! The WebSocket interface of the IBM Watson\u00ae Speech to Text service is the most natural way for a client to interact with the service. Because of their advantages, WebSockets are the preferred mechanism for speech recognition.  The WebSocket interface can take minutes to produce final results for a recognition request for an especially long audio file. For the WebSocket interface, the underlying TCP connection remains idle while the service prepares the response. ",

      "text": "\nThe WebSocket section also discusses the maximum frame or message size of 4 MB enforced by the WebSocket interface.\n\nHTTP and WebSocket interfaces can now return warnings\n: The JSON response for a recognition request can now include an array of warning messages for invalid query parameters or JSON fields that are included with a request. Each element of the array is a string that describes the nature of the warning followed by an array of invalid argument strings. For example, \"warnings\": [ \"Unknown arguments: u'{invalid_arg_1}', u'{invalid_arg_2}'].\" ]. For more information, see the [API & SDK reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/speech-to-text).\n\nBeta Apple iOS SDK is deprecated\n: The beta Watson Speech Software Development Kit (SDK) for the Apple\u00ae iOS operating system is deprecated. Use the Watson SDK for the Apple\u00ae iOS operating system instead. The new SDK is available from the [ios-sdk repository](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk) in the watson-developer-cloud namespace on GitHub.\n\nWebSocket interface can produce delayed results\n: The WebSocket interface can take minutes to produce final results for a recognition request for an especially long audio file. For the WebSocket interface, the underlying TCP connection remains idle while the service prepares the response. Therefore, the connection can close due to a timeout. To avoid the timeout with the WebSocket interface, request interim results (\"interim_results\": \"true\") in the JSON for the start message to initiate the request. You can discard the interim results if you do not need them. This issue will be resolved in a future update.\n\n\n\n\n\n 19 January 2016 \n\nNew profanity filtering feature\n: The service was updated to include a new profanity filtering feature on January 19, 2016. By default, the service censors profanity from its transcription results for US English audio.",

To use the WebSocket interface for speech recognition, you first use the /v1/recognize method to establish a persistent connection with the service. You then send text and binary messages over the connection to initiate and manage recognition requests.\n\nBecause of their advantages, WebSockets are the preferred mechanism for speech recognition. For more information, see [Advantages of the WebSocket interface](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/speech-to-text?topic=speech-to-text-service-featuresfeatures-websocket-advantages). For more information about the WebSocket interface and its parameters, see the [API & SDK reference](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/speech-to-text).\n\n\n\n Managing a WebSocket connection \n\nThe WebSocket recognition request and response cycle has the following steps:\n\n\n\n1.
