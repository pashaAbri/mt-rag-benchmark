You can also choose to integrate your cluster with IBM Cloud services like [Continuous Delivery](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cicd). \n Cluster health You can also set up logging, monitoring, and metering tools by installing and configuring various operators. These solutions are cluster-specific and not highly available unless you back them up. Your clusters feature one-click integrations with IBM Log Analysis and IBM Cloud Monitoring for enterprise-grade, persistent monitoring and logging solutions across clusters. You can also install the logging and monitoring operators as with standard OCP, but you might have to adjust the configuration settings. For more information, see [Logging and monitoring cluster health](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-health). \n Migrating clusters You can use the cluster migrator operator to migrate clusters from one major version to another. Migration requires separate clusters; you can't update a cluster from one major version to another. Various open source tools might be used, but are not officially supported. As with standard OpenShift Container Platform, you can't update a cluster from one major version to another. If you use a third-party open source tool such as the [cluster migrator operator](https://github.com/migtools/mig-operator), the tool is not supported by IBM and might have limitations such as the migration UI being unavailable. \n Container-native virtualization You can set up [container-native virtualization add-on](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/virt/about-virt.html) on bare metal machines, but not on virtual machines. Container-native virtualization is not supported by IBM. If you experience issues, you are responsible for resolving the issues and any impact to your workloads.",

In this tutorial, you complete the following tasks.\n\n\n\n* Create a cluster.\n* Open the Red Hat OpenShift web console.\n* Access common components.\n* Deploy a sample app.\n* Expose the app on a Route so that external users can access the service.\n\n\n\nZoom\n\n![Red Hat OpenShift tutorial diagram.](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/bce0f0917a9eea684d1b4b704ac6343a1f65f446/openshift/images/roks_tutorial.png)\n\nFigure 1. Red Hat OpenShift tutorial diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n Prerequisites \n\n\n\n1. Check your permissions. If you are the account owner, you already have the required permissions to create a cluster and can continue to the next step. If you are not the account owner, ask the account owner to [set up an API key and assign you required permissions in IBM Cloud IAM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-access_referencecluster_create_permissions).\n2. [Install the IBM Cloud CLI tools](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-cli-install).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 1: Create a Red Hat OpenShift on IBM Cloud cluster \n\n\n\n1. Log in to your account and resource group. If you have a federated account, include the --sso option.\n\nibmcloud login [-g RESOURCE GROUP] [--sso]\n2. Run the following command to create a version 4.11 cluster in Washington, DC with 2 worker nodes that have 4 cores and 16 GB memory.",
