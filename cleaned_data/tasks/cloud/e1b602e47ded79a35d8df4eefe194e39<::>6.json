For backward compatibility, both the interpretation and metadata attributes are included with the recognized entity object. The new system entity version is enabled automatically for dialog skills in the Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese languages. You can choose to use the legacy version of the system entities API by switching to it from the Options>System Entities page. This settings page is not displayed in English, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, and Spanish dialog skills because use of the legacy version of the API is no longer supported for those languages. For more information about the new system entities, see [System entities](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-system-entities).\n\n\n\n\n\n 28 October 2020 \n\nIntroducing the actions skill!\n: The actions skill is the latest step in the continuing evolution of Watson Assistant as a software as a service application. The actions skill is designed to make it simple enough for anyone to build a virtual assistant. We've removed the need to navigate between intents, entities, and dialog to create conversational flows. Building can all now be done in one simple and intuitive interface.\n\nThe actions skill is available as a beta feature. For more information, see [Adding an actions skill](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-skill-actions-add).\n\nWeb chat integration is created automatically\n: When you create a new assistant, a web chat integration is created for you automatically (in addition to the preview link integration, which was created previously). These integrations are added also to the assistant that is auto-generated (named My first assistant) when you create a new service instance. For more information, see [Integrating the web chat with your website](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-deploy-web-chat).\n\nText messaging integration was renamed\n: The Twilio messaging integration was renamed to SMS with Twilio.\n\n\n\n\n\n 9 October 2020 \n\nSearch skill update",
