  "gold_answer": "To compare the metrics for different periods, you can use the Time period control to select the desired time frames. You can choose from predefined periods such as a single day, a week, a month, or a quarter, or create custom time periods. The data points on the graph will adjust to an appropriate measurement period for the selected time frame. For example, when viewing a graph for a day, the data is presented in hourly values, but when viewing a graph for a week, the data is shown by day. Additionally, you can use the Refresh data option to ensure the data is up-to-date.",

You can view the amount of traffic for a given time period, as well as the intents and entities that were recognized most often in user conversations.\n\nThe Analytics page was introduced with version 1.5.0. The Analytics feature is supported only on clusters that are installed on Red Hat OpenShift 4.5 or later.\n\nUse the metrics to answer questions like:\n\n\n\n* What was the average number of conversations per week during the last month?\n* How often did customers need to go elsewhwere for support?\n* Which intents appeared most often last week?\n* Which entity values were recognized the most times during February?\n* Which days had the largest or smallest numbers of conversations in the last month?\n\n\n\nTo see metrics information, select Overview in the navigation bar.\n\n\n\n Controls \n\nYou can use the following controls to filter the information:\n\n\n\n* Time period control - Use this control to choose the period for which data is displayed. This control affects all data shown on the page: not just the number of conversations displayed in the graph, but also the statistics displayed along with the graph, and the lists of top intents and entities.\n\nThe statistics can cover a longer time period than the period for which logs of conversations are retained.\n\n![Time period control](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/a2b18c153837bce00a5b4de496e4b4ca64bbf56e/assistant-data/images/oview-time.png)\n\nYou can choose whether to view data for a single day, a week, a month, or a quarter. In each case, the data points on the graph adjust to an appropriate measurement period. For example, when viewing a graph for a day, the data is presented in hourly values, but when viewing a graph for a week, the data is shown by day. A week always runs from Sunday through Saturday.\n\nYou can create custom time periods also, such as a week that runs from Thursday to the following Wednesday, or a month that begins on any date other than the first.",
