  "gold_answer": "The creation of a user ID depends on the specific system or platform you are using to integrate with the IBM Watson Assistant. Typically, the user ID is created and managed by the application that is using the assistant. It is up to the developer of that application to ensure that each user is assigned a unique user ID. You should refer to the documentation of your specific application or platform for instructions on how to create a user ID. Open the App ID instance page from the resource list Services and software section. 2. Go to Manage Authentication \u2192 Cloud Directory \u2192 Users, and click Create User. Enter the user details.\n\nStep 6: Create or modify users' project assignments\n\nIf the IDP administrator will assign users to projects, you can define project values in the user's attributes.",
