When a new version (n) is released, versions up to 2 behind (n-2) are supported. Versions more than 2 behind the latest (n-3) are first deprecated and then unsupported.\n\nFor more information about supported versions and update actions that you must take to move from one version to another, see [Kubernetes version information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions)\n* Which worker node operating systems does the service support?\n\nFor a list of supported worker node operated systems by cluster version, see [Kubernetes version information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_versions).\n* Where is the service available?\n\nIBM Cloud Kubernetes Service is available worldwide. You can create clusters in every supported IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service region.\n\nFor more information about supported regions, see [Locations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zonesregions-and-zones).\n* Is the service highly available?\n\nYes. By default, IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service sets up many components such as the cluster master with replicas, anti-affinity, and other options to increase the high availability (HA) of the service. You can increase the redundancy and failure toleration of your cluster worker nodes, storage, networking, and workloads by configuring them in a highly available architecture. For an overview of the default setup and your options to increase HA, see [High availability for IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-ha).",

They are available 24/7 and can be contacted through the IBM Cloud console, by phone, or via email. The support options available to you depend on your IBM Cloud account type and level. For more information, you can refer to the IBM Cloud documentation on getting help and support.\nIn addition to official support, IBM also offers various resources to help you troubleshoot and resolve issues on your own. These include a comprehensive knowledge base, a community forum where you can ask questions and share knowledge with other IBM Cloud users, and documentation and tutorials on using IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service.\nIf you are unable to find a solution to your issue through these resources, you may want to consider engaging an IBM Cloud partner or consultant for additional assistance.
