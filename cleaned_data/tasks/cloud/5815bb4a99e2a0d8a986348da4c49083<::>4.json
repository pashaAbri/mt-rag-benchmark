An IAM (Identity and Access Management) credential is a type of dynamic secret that you can use to access an IBM Cloud resource that requires IAM authentication.

A static secret has its expiration date and time enforced at secret creation or rotation time. In contrast, a\n\ndynamic secrethas its expiration date and time enforced when its secret data is read or accessed.\n\nSecrets Manager further classifies static and dynamic secrets by their general purpose or function. For example, each secret type is identified by programmatic name, such as username_password. If you're looking to manage your secret by using the Secrets Manager API or CLI, you can use these programmatic names to run operations on secrets according to their type.\n\nReview the following table to understand the types of static and dynamic secrets that you can create and manage with the service.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

Users are identified by their IBMid. Services are identified by their service IDs. And, resources are identified and addressed by using CRNs.\n\nThe IBM Cloud IAM Token Service is used to create, update, delete, and use API keys for users and services. Those API keys are created either with API calls or the Identity & Access section of the IBM Cloud\u00ae Platform Console. The same key can be used across services. Each user has any number of API keys to support key rotation scenarios, as well as scenarios by using different keys for different purposes to limit the exposure of a single key.\n\nFor more information, see [the IAM documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-iamoverviewiamoverview).\n\n\n\n Users and API keys \n\nAPI keys can be created and used by IBM Cloud users for automation and scripting purposes. API keys can be created in the Identity and Access Management UI or by using the ibmcloud CLI.\n\n\n\n\n\n Service IDs and API keys \n\nUsers also can create Service IDs and API keys for Service IDs. A Service ID is similar to a \"functional ID\" or an \"application ID\" and is used to authenticate services, and not to represent a user.\n\nUsers create Service IDs and bind them to scopes, like a IBM Cloud Platform account, a CloudFoundry organization, or a CloudFoundry space. It is best to bind Service IDs to a IBM Cloud Platform account. This binding is done to give the Service ID a container to live in. This container also defines who can update and delete the Service ID and who can create, update, read, and delete API Keys that are associated to that Service ID. It is important to note that a Service ID is NOT related to a user.\n\n\n\n\n\n Key rotation",
