When an alert is triggered, you can be notified through 1 or more notification channels. An alert definition can generate multi-channel notifications.\n\nAn alert is a notification event that you can use to warn about situations that require attention. Each alert has a severity status. This status informs you about the criticality of the information it reports on. [Learn more](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/monitoring?topic=monitoring-alerts).\n\nComplete the following steps to configure an alert:\n\n\n\n Step 1. Select the alert type \n\nFrom the Alert section of the UI, select Add Alert. Then, choose the alert type.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 2. Name the alert \n\nEnter a name for the alert.\n\nYou can also add a description for the alert and the name of an alert group if you want to group you alerts. If an alert group is not specified, the alert will be created in the default group.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 3. Define the severity \n\nAdd a severity level. Valid severity values are info, low, medium, and high.\n\n\n\n\n\n Step 4. Define the metric section \n\n\n\n1. Select a metric (entity) that you want to monitor.\n2. Define the alert condition. Choose any of the following options:\n\nOption 1: Choose a metric and a single condition such as average, sum, minimum or maximum.\n\nOption 2: Choose Create multi-condition alerts. Enter the condition, for example, min(min(cpu.used.percent)) < = 50 OR max(max(cpu.used.percent)) >= 80.\n\nZoom\n\n![Multi-condition alert](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/220cdcbf6f4421bd7fee83fd1028048dba3f16c8/monitoring/monitor/images/multi-condition-alerts.png)\n\nMulti-condition alert",

You can choose from predefined periods such as a single day, a week, a month, or a quarter, or create custom time periods. The data points on the graph will adjust to an appropriate measurement period for the selected time frame. For example, when viewing a graph for a day, the data is presented in hourly values, but when viewing a graph for a week, the data is shown by day. Additionally, you can use the Refresh data option to ensure the data is up-to-date.\n|user|: some example of alerts\n|assistant|: Sure, here's an example of detail alerts: - Name: Enter a name for the alert (e.g., 'High CPU Usage'). - Description: Add a description for more context (optional). - Group: Specify the alert group (or use the default group). - Severity: Set the level of criticality (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low', or 'Info'). - Metric: Configure the metric you want to monitor (e.g., 'CPU usage'). - Scope: Configure the scope (e.g., specific resources, resource groups, or cloud accounts). - Trigger: Define the condition and threshold value that must be evaluated. For instance, you can set an alert to trigger when CPU usage exceeds 80% for at least 5 minutes. - Notification Channel: Enable 1 or more notification channels to receive alert notifications. Remember to save your alert settings after configuring them.

You can also add more metrics by creating custom metrics and adding integrations.\n\nYou can monitor metrics through the Monitoring web UI, or through other platforms like Grafana.\n\nThe following figure shows the components overview for the IBM Cloud Monitoring service that is running on IBM Cloud:\n\nZoom\n\n![IBM Cloud Monitoring component overview on the IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs-content/v1/content/220cdcbf6f4421bd7fee83fd1028048dba3f16c8/monitoring/images/overview.svg)\n\nFigure 1. IBM Cloud Monitoring component overview on the IBM Cloud\n\nWhen you configure a Monitoring agent, data for default metrics is automatically collected. These metrics include metadata that you can use to label, segment, and display metrics when you monitor them. You do not need additional instrumentation or configuration in your hosts to obtain metrics that are collected automatically by the agent to gain insight into what is happening in them.\n\nTo monitor your infrastructure, network, and applications with the IBM Cloud\u00ae Monitoring service, you can deploy Monitoring agents on supported hosts. The host determines the agent type that you can deploy. The agent type determines the metrics that are collected automatically for that host.\n\nTo start collecting default metrics, you must configure a Monitoring agent per environment that you want to monitor.\n\nYou can monitor hosts in IBM Cloud, on-prem, and in other clouds.\n\n\n\nTable 1.

In the context of cloud monitoring, metrics are data points that provide insights into the performance, availability, and usage of resources in your cloud environment. Examples of metrics include CPU utilization, memory consumption, network traffic, and disk I/O operations. By monitoring these metrics, you can identify trends, detect anomalies, and make informed decisions about capacity planning, cost optimization, and system maintenance.\nIn the documents provided, metrics are used in the context of setting up alerts for various conditions based on the collected data. Users can configure alerts to trigger when specific metric thresholds are met or exceeded, allowing them to proactively address potential issues before they impact their services."
