      "text": "\nSupport for every language!\n: You now can build an assistant in any language you want to support. If a dedicated language model is not available for your target language, create a skill that uses the universal language model. The universal model applies a set of shared linguistic characteristics and rules from multiple languages as a starting point. It then learns from training data written in the target language that you add to it.\n\nThe universal model is available as a beta feature. For more information, see [Understanding the universal language model](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-assistant-languageassistant-language-universal).\n\nActions skill improvement\n: Now you can indicate whether or not to ask for a number when you apply a number reply constraint to a step. Test how changes to this setting might help speed up a customer's interaction. Under the right circumstances, it can be useful to let a number mention be recognized and stored without having to explicitly ask the customer for it.\n\n\n\n\n\n 1 March 2021 \n\nIntroducing the Enterprise plan!\n: The Enterprise plan includes all of the market differentiating features of the Plus plan, but with higher capacity limits, additional security features, custom onboarding support to get you going, and a lower overall cost at higher volumes.\n\nTo have a dedicated environment provisioned for your business, request the Enterprise with Data Isolation plan. To submit a request online, go to [http://ibm.biz/contact-wa-enterprise](http://ibm.biz/contact-wa-enterprise).\n\nThe Enterprise plan is replacing the Premium plan. The Premium plan is being retired today. Existing Premium plan users are not impacted. They can continue to work in their Premium instances and create instances up to the 30-instance limit. New users do not see the Premium plan as an option when they create a service instance.\n\nFor more information, see the [Pricing](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-assistant/pricing/) page.\n\nOther plan changes\n: Our pricing has been revised to reflect the features we've added that help you build an assistant that functions as a powerful omnichannel SaaS application.",
