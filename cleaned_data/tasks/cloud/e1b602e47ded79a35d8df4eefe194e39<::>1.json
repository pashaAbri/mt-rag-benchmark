The default value is English.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you create the dialog skill, it appears as a tile on the Skills page. Now, you can start identifying the user goals that you want the dialog skill to address.\n\n\n\n* To add prebuilt intents to your skill, see [Using content catalogs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-catalog).\n* To define your own intents, see [Defining intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents).\n\n\n\nThe dialog skill cannot interact with customers until it is added to an assistant and the assistant is deployed. See [Creating an assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-assistant-add).\n\n\n\n Troubleshooting skill import issues \n\nIf you receive warnings when you try to upload a skill, take a moment to try to fix the issues.\n\n\n\n1. Make a note of the warning message that are displayed when you try to upload the JSON file.\n2. Edit the skill to address the issues.\n\n\n\n* If you have access to a public service instance, open the skill from there and make edits. Export the edited skill by downloading it.\n* Otherwise, open the JSON file in a text editor and make edits.\n\n\n\nYou might need to remove the @sys-person and @sys-location entities from your training data, and any references to them from dialog nodes, for example.\n3. Try again to import the edited skill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Adding the skill to an assistant \n\nYou can add one skill to an assistant. You must open the assistant tile and add the skill to the assistant from the assistant configuration page; you cannot choose the assistant that will use the skill from within the skill configuration page. One dialog skill can be used by more than one assistant.\n\n\n\n1. Click the Assistants icon !",

Then, as you build a dialog for the dialog skill, you decide when to initiate the search skill. For some questions or requests, a hardcoded or programmatically-derived response (that is defined in the dialog skill) is sufficient. For others, you might want to provide a more robust response by returning a full passage of related information (that is extracted from an external data source by using the search skill).\n\n\n\n Dialog skill \n\nA dialog skill contains the training data and logic that enables an assistant to help your customers. It contains the following types of artifacts:\n\n\n\n* [Intents](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant-data?topic=assistant-data-intents): An intent represents the purpose of a user's input, such as a question about business locations or a bill payment. You define an intent for each type of user request you want your application to support. In the tool, the name of an intent is always prefixed with the character. To train the dialog skill to recognize your intents, you supply lots of examples of user input and indicate which intents they map to.\n\nA content catalog is provided that contains prebuilt common intents you can add to your application rather than building your own. For example, most applications require a greeting intent that starts a dialog with the user. You can add the General content catalog to add an intent that greets the user and does other useful things, like end the conversation.",

The coverage metric measures the rate at which your dialog is confident that it can address a customer's request per message. For conversations that are not covered, you can review the logs to learn more about what the customer wanted. For the metric to work, you must design your dialog to include an Anything else node that is processed when no other dialog node intents are matched.
