  "gold_answer": "   There are general steps to gather the relevant worker node data: First,  Check the conditions of your worker nodes and cluster before you gather data. This includes checking the CPU and memory level of your nodes. If any node is over 80% in either CPU or memory usage, consider provisioning more nodes or reducing your workload.Secondly if all worker nodes in a cluster, or in a single zone, subnet, or VLAN are affected, you can open an initial support ticket without gathering data. However, you might later be asked to gather the relevant data. If only one or some of your worker nodes are affected, you must gather the relevant data to include in your support ticket.  Before opening a support ticket, it is recommended to review the information and follow any troubleshooting steps in Debugging worker nodes, Worker node states, and Troubleshooting worker nodes in Critical or NotReady state. To gather worker node data, you can use the command 'kubectl top node' (for Kubernetes clusters) or 'oc top node' (for OpenShift clusters), which will display the CPU and memory usage of each node and once you have gathered this information, include it in your support ticket when you open one.
